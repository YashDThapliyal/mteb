Jason Voorhees Jason Voorhees is the main character from the Friday the 13th series . He first appeared in Friday the 13th ( 1980 ) as the young son of camp cook-turned-murderer Mrs. Voorhees , in which he was portrayed by Ari Lehman . Created by Victor Miller , with contributions by Ron Kurz , Sean S. Cunningham , and Tom Savini , Jason was not originally intended to carry the series as the main antagonist . The character has subsequently been represented in various other media , including novels , video games , comic books , and a cross-over film with another iconic horror film character , Freddy Krueger .   The character has primarily been an antagonist in the films , whether by stalking and killing the other characters , or acting as a psychological threat to the protagonist , as is the case in Friday the 13th : A New Beginning . Since Lehman 's portrayal , the character has been represented by numerous actors and stuntmen , sometimes by more than one at a time ; this has caused some controversy as to who should receive credit for the portrayal . Kane Hodder is the best known of the stuntmen to portray Jason Voorhees , having played the character in four consecutive films .   The character 's physical appearance has gone through many transformations , with various special makeup effects artists making their mark on the character 's design , including makeup artist Stan Winston . Tom Savini 's initial design has been the basis for many of the later incarnations . The trademark hockey goalie mask did not appear until Friday the 13th Part III . Since Friday the 13th Part VI : Jason Lives , filmmakers have given Jason superhuman strength , regenerative powers , and near invulnerability . He has been seen as a sympathetic character , whose motivation for killing has been cited as being driven by the immoral actions of his victims and his own rage over having drowned as a child . Jason Voorhees has been featured in various humor magazines , referenced in feature films , parodied in television shows , and was the inspiration for a horror punk band . Several toy lines have been released based on various versions of the character from the Friday the 13th films . Jason Voorhees 's hockey mask is a widely recognized image in popular culture .

The Quranic text seems to have no beginning, middle, or end, its nonlinear structure being akin to a web or net. The textual arrangement is sometimes considered to exhibit lack of continuity, absence of any chronological or thematic order and repetitiousness. Michael Sells, citing the work of the critic Norman O. Brown, acknowledges Brown's observation that the seeming disorganization of Quranic literary expression – its scattered or fragmented mode of composition in Sells's phrase – is in fact a literary device capable of delivering profound effects as if the intensity of the prophetic message were shattering the vehicle of human language in which it was being communicated. Sells also addresses the much-discussed repetitiveness of the Quran, seeing this, too, as a literary device.
Tanzania Tanzania -LSB- ˌtænzəˈniːə -RSB- , officially the United Republic of Tanzania ( Jamhuri ya Muungano wa Tanzania ) , is a country in Eastern Africa within the African Great Lakes region . Parts of the country are in Southern Africa . It is bordered by Kenya and Uganda to the north ; Rwanda , Burundi , and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west ; Zambia , Malawi , and Mozambique to the south ; and by the Indian Ocean to the east . Mount Kilimanjaro , Africa 's highest mountain , is in northeastern Tanzania .   Tanzania 's population of 51.82 million ( 2014 ) is diverse , composed of several ethnic , linguistic , and religious groups . Tanzania is a presidential constitutional republic , and since 1996 , its official capital city has been Dodoma , where the President 's Office , the National Assembly , and some government ministries are located . Dar es Salaam , the former capital , retains most government offices and is the country 's largest city , principal port , and leading commercial centre . Tanzania is a one party dominant state with the socialist-progressive Chama Cha Mapinduzi ( CCM ) party in power . From its formation until 1992 , it was the only legally permitted party in the country . This changed on 1 July 1992 , when amendments to the Constitution and a number of laws permitting and regulating the formation and operations of more than one political party were enacted by the National Assembly . Elections for president and all National Assembly seats were last held in October 2015 . The CCM holds approximately 75 % of the seats in the assembly .   Prehistoric population migrations include Southern Cushitic speakers , who are ancestral to the Iraqw , Gorowa , and Burunge and who moved south from Ethiopia into Tanzania . Based on linguistic evidence , there may also have been two movements into Tanzania of Eastern Cushitic people at about 4,000 and 2,000 years ago , originating from north of Lake Turkana . Archaeological evidence supports the conclusion that Southern Nilotes , including the Datoog , moved south from the present-day South Sudan-Ethiopia border region into central northern Tanzania between 2,900 and 2,400 years ago . These movements took place at about the same time as the settlement of the iron-making Mashariki Bantu from West Africa in the Lake Victoria and Lake Tanganyika areas . They brought with them the west African planting tradition and the primary staple of yams . They subsequently migrated out of these regions across the rest of Tanzania , between 2,300 and 1,700 years ago . European colonialism began in mainland Tanzania during the late 19th century when Germany formed German East Africa , which gave way to British rule following World War I . The mainland was governed as Tanganyika , with the Zanzibar Archipelago remaining a separate colonial jurisdiction . Following their respective independence in 1961 and 1963 , the two entities merged in April 1964 to form the United Republic of Tanzania .   Tanzania is mountainous and densely forested in the northeast , where Mount Kilimanjaro is located . Three of Africa 's Great Lakes are partly within Tanzania . To the north and west lie Lake Victoria , Africa 's largest lake , and Lake Tanganyika , the continent 's deepest lake , known for its unique species of fish . The eastern shore is hot and humid , with the Zanzibar Archipelago just offshore . The Kalambo water falls in the southwestern region of Rukwa are the second highest uninterrupted fall in Africa and are located near the southeastern shore of Lake Tanganyika on the border with Zambia . The Menai Bay Conservation Area is Zanzibar 's largest marine protected area .   Over 100 different languages are spoken in Tanzania , making it the most linguistically diverse country in East Africa . Among the languages spoken in Tanzania are all four of Africa 's language families : Bantu , Cushitic , Nilotic , and Khoisan . Swahili and English are Tanzania 's official languages . A highly multilingual country , Swahili is used in parliamentary debate , in the lower courts , an
What is the difference between Market Order and Limit Order? Which one is wise to use? Business & Finance Investing What is the difference between Market Order and Limit Order? Which one is wise to use? Plz explain in layman terms, as I am beginner to Share Markets Follow Answers Relevance Rating Newest Oldest Best Answer: Market order will execute your order at the current market price. Limit order is a conditional order, it will get executed at the price specified by you or at a price beneficial to you. As an example, if you place a BUY order for 1000 Nos. of X stock at a limit price of Rs.100, the stock will be bought at Rs.100 or lesser depending on the market availability. Similarly in the case of SELL it will be excuted at Rs.100 or more. It is always better to specify the limit value as sometimes, the order will be queued and may not get executed due to some system delay, then if you had placed the market order, the order might get executed at a price which is not favourable to the investor. I came across one site which is suitable for the beginner in trading, which you can also go through.,Source (s):http://www.sharetips4u.info Roshan L · 1 decade ago1 0 Comment Market Order Vs Limit Order Source (s):https://shrink.im/a8LDbbayona · 2 years ago0 0 Comment To start, MARKET order means you're telling the market you want ### number of shares, and you're given them at a price usually somewhere between the ask and bid (ask/bid spread). In a high volume market, it's pretty safe to do a market order, and if you're buying for the long run, then saving a few pennies on your order will mean nothing. For long term investments, just do a market order to raise your odds of a quick order execution. REMEMBER - many people forget this, it's not like you can just buy a stock whenever you want, there has to be a seller to meet your order. In high volume markets, you're pretty much guaranteed this with a market order. Now, with LIMIT order, you're telling the market you want ### number of shares at a certain price. This is used more in lower volume markets and lower priced stocks. Example, for a stock priced at $1, every penny = 1%, so a limit order is a must to save you from placing an order that executes pennies above the current trade price, where you basically incure an immediate loss if the price returns to what it was initially at. There are also stop, stop limit, and trailing stop orders, but if you're a beginner, don't worry about them, but look them up and see what they're all about too. CONJ · 1 decade ago1 0 Comment A market order means you will pay whatever the market demands. A limit order is where YOU set the price you want to buy and sell. With a limit order there are no surprises. By placing a market order you are at the mercy of the market and may overpay or undersell. ALWAYS use limit orders Ryan M · 1 decade ago0 0 Comment1. market order means you want to buy or sell at any price that is available 2. limit order means you want to buy or sell at certain price or better 3. it depends on the purpose of your orders. If you want to open a position then the limit order would be better and if you want to cut loss then the market order would be better. Source (s): Investing in Stock http://investinginstock.blogspot.comd10 · 1 decade ago0 0 Comment When you specifiy a market order, it will be executed immediately at the current price. When you set a limit, the execution will take place only when the price reaches that point. If the stock is thinly traded, a market order can be executed at a lot less than the last trade. SDD · 1 decade ago0 0 Comment Market order is when u tell your broker to sell or buy a share at current prevailing price eg Reliance right now is quoting at 2635 and u tell ur broker to buy/sell at this price or nearit. it is a market price order. suyppose u want to buy at 2630 and your broker puts a bid to buy ,say, 100 shares at 2630. this is limit order.

2003–04 Houston Rockets season The 2003–04 NBA season was the Rockets' 37th season in the National Basketball Association, and their 33rd season in the city of Houston. The season saw the Rockets move their home games from Compaq Center to the new Toyota Center. During the offseason, the Rockets hired head coach Jeff Van Gundy, who is best known for his tenure with the New York Knicks, and signed free agent Jim Jackson. Midway through the season, they signed free agent point guard Mark Jackson. The Rockets finished fifth in the Midwest Division with a 45–37 record, and qualified for the playoffs for the first time since 1999 as the number 7 seed in the Western Conference. Second-year star Yao Ming and Steve Francis were both selected for the 2004 NBA All-Star Game. However, the Rockets were eliminated from the first round of the playoffs by the Los Angeles Lakers, who added Karl Malone and Gary Payton to join Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, in five games. This also marked Francis' only playoff appearance in his career. Following the season, he was traded along with Cuttino Mobley and Kelvin Cato to the Orlando Magic, and Mark Jackson retired.
Thoracic aortic aneurysms Thoracic aortic aneurysms (Redirected from Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms)navigation search Contents [ hide ]1 Definition2 Etiology3 Echocardiography3.1 Transthoracic echocardiography3.2 Transoesophageal echocardiography4 Aorta size [2]5 Normal values [2]6 Recommendation7 References Definition Aortic aneurysm is a pathological dilatation of the normal aortic lumen involving one or several segments . The most used criterion defines aneurysm as a permanent dilatation at least 1,5 times that of expected normal diameter of that given aortic segment [ 1], although no definition is universally accepted. Aneurysms are described in terms of location, size, morphological appearance and origin. The morphology of an aortic aneurysm is :fusiform - the most common shape, with symmetrical dilatation of the full circumference of the aortic wallsaccular - a more localized dilatation that involves only a portion of the aortic wall [ 1]The presence of an aortic aneurysm may be a marker of more diffuse aortic disease; 25-28% of patients with thoracic aortic aneurysms have concomitant abdominal aortic aneurysms . Thus, a patients in whom an aortic aneurysm is discovered should undergo examination of the entire aorta for the possible presence of other aneurysms [ 1]. Thoracic aortic aneurysms are much less common than aneurysms of the abdominal aorta. The main classification of thoracic aortic aneurysms is anatomical (ascending aorta, aortic arch or descending aorta), because the etiology, natural history and treatment differ for each of these aortic segments involved [ 1]. Aneurysms of ascending aorta occur most commonly , followed by aneurysms of descending aorta, whereas aortic arch or thoracoabdominal aneurysms occur less often [ 1]. Etiology Aneurysms of ascending thoracic aorta often result from cystic medial necrosis, leading to a weakening of the aortic wall, which results in formation of fusiform aneurysms. Such aneurysms often involve the aortic root and may consequently result in aortic regurgitation; this association is called annuloaortic ectasia. Cystic medial necrosis occurs :at younger ages in association withconective tissue disorders ( Marfan, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome)familial thoracic aortic aneurysm syndromebicuspid aortic valvein older ages, accelerated by hypertension [ 1]Atherosclerosis is the main cause of descending aorta aneurysms and infrequently leads to ascending aorta aneurysms (only when is associated with diffuse aortic atherosclerosis) [ 1] . Aneurysms in aortic arch are contiguous with those of ascending or descending aorta and have the same etiology (cystic medial necrosis or atherosclerosis). Syphilis and infectious aortitis are nowadays very rare causes of ascending aorta aneurysms [ 1] . Aortic aneurysms are an important cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Except when complications are life-threatening, such as acute aortic syndrome or aortic rupture, most aortic aneurysms are asymptomatic and without abnormalities on physical examination; thus, diagnosis and follow-up depend exclusively on imaging techniques. Echocardiography Echocardiography has become the most used imaging test and plays an important role in the diagnosis and follow-up of aortic diseases [ 2] . Transthoracic echocardiography Transthoracic echocardiography is one of the techniques most used to measure proximal aortic segments in clinical practice. Using different windows, the proximal ascending aorta is visualized in the left and right parasternal long-axis views and, to a lesser extent, in basal short-axis views. In all patients with suspected aortic disease, the right parasternal view is recommended for estimating the true size of the ascending aorta. The ascending aorta is also visualized in the apical long-axis and modified apical five- chamber views; however, in these views, the aortic walls are seen with suboptimal lateral resolution. Modified subcostal views may in some cases (more frequently in children) be helpful, but here the ascending aorta is far from the transducer. All these views also per

The crankshaft is located in the engine of a vehicle and converts the force created by the engine's pistons moving up and down into a force that moves the wheels in a circular motion so the car can go forward.Located inside the car's engine, it is connected to all the pistons in the engine and to the flywheel.he pistons, which are attached to the crankshaft in an engine, are moved down by the explosions inside the cylinders. When the pistons move down, the crankshaft rotates. The pistons are connected to the crankshaft to ensure it moves with them and keeps their movements regulated.
From a public policy perspective, the extreme cost and loss of liberty that a ban would require outweighs the harm tobacco products do. Cigarettes are harmful over the long term, but from a societal perspective, fairly benign over the short term. Nicotine addicts are fully functional members of society. Unlike most other drugs, you are not impaired while under the influence, you don't fly into a rage or crash cars. Overdoses are rare and you don't have to keep using more and more to get the same effect.  Sure, the health consequences will eventually catch up with you and some of that cost will likely be born by society. But that is true for many activities, like overeating, lack of exercise, or riding a motorcycle.

The "Notre Dame Victory March" is the fight song for the University of Notre Dame. It was written by two brothers who were Notre Dame graduates. The Rev. Michael J. Shea, a 1904 graduate, wrote the music, and his brother, John F. Shea, who earned degrees in 1906 and 1908, wrote the original lyrics. The lyrics were revised in the 1920s; it first appeared under the copyright of the University of Notre Dame in 1928. The chorus is, "Cheer cheer for old Notre Dame, wake up the echos cheering her name. Send a volley cheer on high, shake down the thunder from the sky! What though the odds be great or small, old Notre Dame will win over all. While her loyal sons are marching, onward to victory!"

With few exceptions, chemical nerve agents are very volatile, and break down quickly. For this reason, and because they are *extremely* hazardous, nerve agents are stored as benign precusor agents. These are mixed together just prior to use to create the nerve agent itself.  When chemical weapons facilities are destroyed, only the precusor chemicals are released. While some incidental mixing may occur if agent precursors are stored together, it generally creates negligible volumes of active agent. Other chemical agents, such as blister, blood, and lung agents, are stored in their active state, and can be released during an attack. But because military infrastructure is usually remote, and because chemical agents affect a small geographic area, the effects of such an event would be limited.

Gamma globulin This article needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (May 2016) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message)Schematic representation of a protein electrophoresis gel Gamma globulins are a class of globulins, identified by their position after serum protein electrophoresis. [1] [2] The most significant gamma globulins are immunoglobulins ( antibodies ), although some immunoglobulins are not gamma globulins, and some gamma globulins are not immunoglobulins. Contents [ hide ]1 Use as medical treatment2 Pathology3 References4 External links Use as medical treatment [ edit]Further information: Intravenous immunoglobulin Gamma globulin injections are usually given in an attempt to temporarily boost a patient's immunity against disease. Being a product derived from bone marrow and lymph gland cells, gamma globulin injections, along with blood transfusions and intravenous drug use, can pass along hepatitis C to their recipients. Once hepatitis C was identified in 1989, blood banks began screening all blood donors for the presence of the virus in their bloodstream. However, since hepatitis C is known to have been present since at least the 1940s, a gamma globulin shot received prior to the early 1990s put the recipient at risk of being infected. Injections are most commonly used on patients having been exposed to hepatitis A or measles, or to make a kidney donor and a recipient compatible regardless of blood type or tissue match. Injections are also used to boost immunity in patients unable to produce gamma globulins naturally because of an immune deficiency, such as X-linked agammaglobulinemia and hyper Ig M syndrome. Such injections are less common in modern medical practice than they were previously, and injections of gamma globulin previously recommended for travelers have largely been replaced by the use of hepatitis A vaccine. Gamma globulin infusions are also used to treat some immunological diseases, such as idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP), a disease in which the platelets are being attacked by antibodies, leading to seriously low platelet counts. It appears that gamma globulin causes the spleen to ignore the antibody-tagged platelets, thus allowing them to survive and function. A recent clinical trial of gamma globulin in chronic fatigue syndrome patients had no recognizable benefit, while an older trial showed improvement. The success of this treatment remains uncertain. [ citation needed]Another theory on how gamma globulin administration works in autoimmune disease is by overloading the mechanisms that degrade gamma globulins. Overloading the degradation mechanism causes the harmful gamma globulins to have a much shorter halflife in sera. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may be used in Kawasaki disease. Intravenous gamma globulin was FDA-approved in 2004 to reduce antibodies in a patient with kidney failure to allow that person to accept a kidney from a donor with a different blood type (ABO-incompatible), or who is an unacceptable tissue match. Stanley Jordan at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles pioneered this treatment. [3]Pathology [ edit]An excess is known as hypergammaglobulinemia. A deficiency is known as hypogammaglobulinemia. A disease of gamma globulins is called a "gammopathy" (for example, in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance ). References [ edit]^ S.

Stonewall Jackson From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedianavigation search This article is about the Confederate general. For other uses, see Stonewall Jackson (disambiguation).

Lee. [2] Jackson played a prominent role in nearly all military engagements in the Eastern Theater of the war until his death, and had an important part in winning many significant battles. Born in what was then part of Virginia, Jackson received an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, served in the U. S. Army during the Mexican–American War of 1846–1848 and distinguished himself at Chapultepec (1847). From 1851 to 1863 he taught at the Virginia Military Institute, where he was unpopular with his students. During this time, he married twice. His first wife died, but his second, Mary Anna Morrison, outlived him by many years. When Virginia seceded from the Union in May 1861 after the attack on Fort Sumter (12 April 1861), Jackson followed it and joined the Confederate Army. He distinguished himself commanding a brigade at the First Battle of Bull Run (21 July 1861) the following month, providing crucial reinforcements and beating back a fierce Union assault. In this context Barnard Elliott Bee Jr., allegedly highlighting Jackson's courage and tenacity, compared him to a "stone wall", hence his enduring nickname. Jackson performed audaciously in 1862's campaigns in the Shenandoah Valley. Despite an initial defeat due largely to faulty intelligence, through swift and careful maneuvers Jackson was able to defeat three separate Union armies and prevent any of them from reinforcing General George B. Mc Clellan 's Army of the Potomac in its campaign against Richmond. Jackson then quickly moved his three divisions to reinforce General Lee's Army of Northern Virginia in its defense of Richmond. His performance in the subsequent Seven Days Battles (June–July 1862) against George B. Mc Clellan 's Army of the Potomac was poor, but did not cost the Confederacy the battles. During the Northern Virginia Campaign that summer, Jackson's troops captured and destroyed an important supply depot for General John Pope 's Army of Virginia, and then withstood repeated assaults from Pope's troops at the Second Battle of Bull Run (August 1862). Jackson's troops played a prominent role in September's Maryland Campaign, capturing the town of Harpers Ferry, an important strategic location, and providing an important defense of the Confederate Army's 
What you need to know about alopecia areata Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease. Autoimmune means that the body's immune system attacks the body. When alopecia areata develops, the body attacks its own hair follicles. A person's genetic makeup, combined with other factors, triggers this form of hair loss.
Kevlar is a fabric, which spreads the impact of a bullet across a larger area. The blade of a knife can slip between the threads of the fabric. A fragmenting bullet is still lead, which is soft, and warps before passing through the weave. A lead knife probably would be stopped by kevlar, but a steel knife wouldn't be.

View repair cost for a different car Get a repair estimate for your car Submit What is a front strut/shock absorber? A front strut, commonly called a Mac Pherson strut, is a suspension assembly that is integral to the front suspension and steering system of a vehicle. A loaded front strut assembly consists of two basic components, a coil spring and a shock absorber. The coil spring is in place to support the weight of the vehicle and to absorb large bumps. It allows the front suspension to travel up and down so that the vehicle body can remain stable. The shock absorber runs through the center of the spring and eases smaller bumps, dampens vibrations, and lends stability to the vehicle. How does the front strut/shock absorber work? The two components of a loaded front strut - the coil spring and the shock absorber - are mounted together in an assembly that is connected to the vehicle's steering knuckle. The steering knuckle is attached to the steering system by way of the tie rod so that the front wheels can be turned. The top of the strut assembly bolts to the vehicle body in the strut tower, where it is able to pivot when the steering wheel is turned. The bottom is connected (by way of the steering knuckle) to the lower control arm and wheel hub. The strut assembly allows the vehicle suspension to rotate while it absorbs impact from rough terrain, helps maintain contact between the tires and the ground, and offers a smoother ride for passengers. Find a Certified Mechanic Find a high quality auto repair shop or dealer near youx What are the symptoms related to a bad front strut/shock absorber? Worn front struts result in diminished ride quality that might feel “soft,” as the vehicle leans excessively during turns, and bounces over bumps. The shock absorber in the strut may leak when it is worn. The strut may also cause a knocking or rattling sound if it is worn, damaged, or broken. If the vehicle leans excessively in turns, and bounces up and down over bumps, the struts are likely worn. If the strut rattles or knocks over bumps, it may be broken. Can I drive with a front strut/shock absorber problem? A vehicle with worn front struts can be driven, but the ride quality will be diminished, and, more importantly, the vehicle's handling will be compromised. A car's ability to remain level while turning, with traction spread between all four wheels, is dependent on the struts. As the condition of the front struts worsens, the ability of the suspension to perform properly, especially in an emergency situation, also worsens. Loss of control and chance of vehicle rollover can be the result of severely worn struts. If a front strut is broken (rather than worn), the vehicle should not be driven until the strut can be replaced. How often do front strut/shock absorbers need to be replaced? There is no replacement schedule for front struts, through many vehicles will need to have them changed at some point. Rough driving habits may shorten the life of these parts. Struts may need to be replaced anywhere between 50k and 100k miles. If at any time the struts are leaking, broken, or damaged, they should be replaced immediately. Struts should always be replaced in pairs.

Is Sesame Oil Healthy? Is Sesame Oil Healthy?by JINAN BANNA Oct. 03, 2017Fat serves a variety of roles in the body, including insulation and cushioning of organs. You can obtain fat in your diet through several sources, but oils of plant origin are generally healthier than animal-source fats because of their decreased saturated-fat content. Sesame oil, which is extracted from sesame seeds, is a healthy source of fat, with a small amount of saturated fat and large amounts of heart-healthy fat. Video of the Day Error loading player: Flash plugin failed to load Calories Sesame oil is pure fat, so it is high in calories compared to other foods. One tablespoon contains 120 calories, or approximately 6 percent of the total calories needed daily for someone who consumes 2,000 calories. All other oils contain the same number of calories per tablespoon, as they are also composed only of fat. Use sesame oil in moderation to keep your intake under control. Unsaturated Fat The fat found in sesame oil is mostly "healthy" fat; 1 tbsp. contains 8 g of monounsaturated fat, which is comparable to olive oil, which has 10 g in 1 tbsp. Sesame oil also contains some polyunsaturated fat, with 2 g in 1 tbsp., compared to 4 g in olive oil. Both types of fat increase "good" HDL cholesterol and decrease "bad" LDL cholesterol. Saturated Fat There is not a high amount of saturated fat in sesame oil, with 2 g in 1 tbsp. Olive oil contains the same amount. Saturated fat has been shown to increase risk of heart disease by increasing harmful LDL cholesterol and decreasing beneficial HDL. Vitamins and Minerals Sesame oil does not contain vitamins and minerals in significant amounts; 1 tbsp. contains only 0.19 mg vitamin E and 1.8 mcg vitamin K. Sesame seeds in their whole form, however, contain larger amounts of nutrients, with 88 mg calcium, 32 mg magnesium, 42 mg potassium and 9 mcg folate. Lose Weight.

No. Even in a nebula the gasses are absurdly sparse, and not even within several orders of magnitude of the density we'd need to breathe. And that's assuming it's pure oxygen, which it obviously wouldn't be.
Separation barrier populated Free Zone. The Berlin Wall was a barrier that divided Berlin from 1961 to 1989, constructed by the German Democratic Republic (GDR, East Germany) starting on 13 August 1961, that completely cut off (by land) West Berlin from surrounding East Germany and from East Berlin until it was opened in November 1989. Its demolition officially began on 13 June 1990 and was completed in 1992. The barrier included guard towers placed along large concrete walls, which circumscribed a wide area (later known as the "death strip") that contained anti-vehicle trenches, "fakir beds" and other defenses.

On the one hand, it is a strong form of social constructionism. On the other hand, it has its origins in Romantic era ideas of national mysticism, in which languages were thought to embody a Volksgeist, a "national spirit" and identity of the people who spoke them. [1] The hypothesis asserts that aspects of language, including not only the ideas specified in its lexicon, but even technical details such as the ways it uses to specify grammatical tenses and its use of copulas, all create a complex gestalt or world view that can only be imperfectly translated to another language. Contents [ hide ]1 Weak and strong2 Popular incarnations2.1 Eskimo snow3 See also4 External links5 Notes Weak and strong [ edit]It comes in two forms, the weak hypothesis and strong hypothesis, although this distinction originates with neither Sapir nor Whorf. [2] The strong version states that language influences how we think and allows us particular modes of thought, creating our cognitive categories which in turn control cognitive processes. This is also referred to as linguistic determinism. The weak version states that our linguistic categories merely influence our thoughts, but do not create or control the cognitive processes, or restrict certain thoughts because the language terms do not exist (as in Newspeak). There is no hard and fast boundary between the "weak" and "strong" versions of linguistic relativity; they merely open up debate as to the strength of the effect language has on thought processes. Most research into language disfavours the strongest formulations of the idea, and so remaining controversies are as to the scale extent that language does influence thought and whether experimental observations can be explained by other cultural factors. Popular incarnations [ edit]The limitation of thought and action by the control of language is the principle behind George Orwell's " Newspeak ." As Orwell explains in the appendix to Nineteen Eighty-Four :“”...a heretical thought - that is, a thought diverging from the principles of Ing Soc - should be literally unthinkable, at least so far as thought is dependent on words. The principles of Newspeak relied on strong linguistic relativity, which does not have much empirical support as being the case. Concepts and thought are not controlled and limited by language, but they are influenced for instance in the naming of colours, language plays a key part in what colours people can describe in a single word and research suggests an order in which they are prioritised. All languages at least have words for "black" and "white", but purple and pink are often left indescribable until the language is given more terms to describe colours. This doesn't mean that the very concept of those distinct colours is impossible to think about, as the strong Sapir-Whorf hypothesis may seem to suggest. A language can always name colors for which it lacks specific terms with compounds or words for objects bearing that color (just as crayon manufacturers come up with names like orange-red and cornflower). A few languages, like the Pirahã language, lack specific words for anything besides light and dark, but far from being unable to v

Good Luckvickie b · 1 decade ago0 0 Comment Stress can cause several things to happen to your period. It can make it lighter, heavier, possibly even miss your period. When your bodies balance gets upset it can mess with you several ways. Regulation of menstrual periods is controlled by a complex hormonal balance. Likewise, the body's reaction to stress involves changes in the levels of many hormones. Because it affects hormone balance and many other processes in the body, psychological stress can also interfere with the menstrual cycle.

On Feb 25, 2014, four people climbed into a new Ford Ranger, albeit one filled with trash. It was a contest sponsored by radio station hitz fm called “Ford: Live In It To Win It." Contestants had to remain in the car without showering, air conditioning, or being able to move about in the vehicle (but thankfully they were allowed a 15-minute bathroom break every 3 hours. )Twenty-three days later, Sritharan was the only one left in the hot, smelly car, and he drove away the prize.

Just touch something as long as you can, in this case a truck, but as the minutes, hours, and even days slip away, it becomes extremely difficult to stay awake with your hands on the hood. The most famous event was called “Hands on a Hardbody” and first began in 1992, at a Nissan dealer in Texas (a Hardbody is a type of Nissan truck). Participants were allowed a 5-minute break every hour and 15 minutes every six; that competition lasted 87 hours. In 1995, the now-annual event was the subject of a documentary of the same name, this time lasting 77 hours. The film became a cult classic and spawned a Broadway musical. Famed director Robert Altman was rumored to be working on a fictional adaptation before he died. In 2005, one contestant, Richard Vega, dropped out after 48 hours, then walked across the street, stole a gun and killed himself. His wife sued the dealership, accusing them of “brainwashing” contestants, causing them to temporarily go insane. The matter was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum and the contest was discontinued.

These took place in ballrooms across the country and were quite the spectacle. They all had different rules for breaks, but the longest one on record for that period was won by Mike Ritof and Edith Boudreaux who somehow slow-danced from August 29, 1930, to April 1, 1931 for a total of 5,5152 hours. For their efforts they took home a $2000 (worth about $28,000 today). Eventually, dance marathons were banned in the US.

How Long to Keep Records for Business Taxes How Long to Keep Records for Business Taxes The length of time you need to keep records depends on the action or expense each document records. You may need to hold on to some records permanently, but typically for business taxes, you only need to keep records supporting income or deductions on a return until the period of limitations for that return is up. The period of limitations is the time-span you can amend a tax return to get credit or a refund. Even if you no longer need records for tax purposes, you may still decide to keep them, as other organizations may require them. Get started Ask a Lawyer a Question You'll hear back in one business day. Here are some of the standard limitation periods on tax-related documents, according to the IRS: If you owe additional taxes, keep records for 3 years If you do not report income that should have been reported, and it exceeds 25% of the gross income on your return, keep records for 6 years If you file a fraudulent return, keep records indefinitely If you do not file a return, keep records indefinitely If you file a claim for credit or refund after filing your return, keep records for 3 years from the filing of the original return If you file a claim for a loss due to bad debt deduction or worthless securities, keep records for 7 years Keep all employment records for at least 4 years after the tax is due or paid Some business records should be kept permanently: Audit reports and charts of accounts Canceled checks for important payments Records of capital stocks and bonds Cash books Contracts and leases still in effect Legal correspondence Deeds, mortgages, bills of sale End of year financial statements Insurance records Minutes, bylaws and charters Property appraisals and records State and federal income tax returns Trademark registrations Other records are commonly kept only up to seven years: Accident reports and claims Ledgers and schedules for accounts payable and receivable Bank statements Most canceled checks Expired contracts and leases Product, material and supply inventory Customer and vendor invoices Ledger and schedules for notes receivable Option records Payroll account records Purchase orders Sales records Canceled stock and bond certificates Vouchers For more information about business taxes, go to www.irs.gov.

Battle of Reims (1814) heavy casualties and the defeats at Craonne and Laon. According to the historian F.W.O. Maycock, success at Reims was, "surely one of the greatest triumphs of [Napoleon's] remarkable career, and speaks volumes for his powers as a leader of men". Napoleon once again interposed between the forces of Blücher and Schwarzenberg, putting him in position to move on the latter's line of communications. Battle of Reims (1814) The Battle of Reims (12–13 March 1814) was fought at Reims, France between an Imperial French army commanded by Emperor Napoleon and a combined Russian-Prussian corps led by General Emmanuel de Saint-Priest.

Electromagnet From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedianavigation search For a broader coverage related to this topic, see Electromagnetism. A simple electromagnet consisting of a coil of wire wrapped around an iron core. A core of ferromagnetic material like iron serves to increase the magnetic field created. [1] The strength of magnetic field generated is proportional to the amount of current through the winding. [1]Magnetic field produced by a solenoid (coil of wire). This drawing shows a cross section through the center of the coil. The crosses are wires in which current is moving into the page; the dots are wires in which current is moving up out of the page. An electromagnet is a type of magnet in which the magnetic field is produced by an electric current. The magnetic field disappears when the current is turned off. Electromagnets usually consist of wire wound into a coil. A current through the wire creates a magnetic field which is concentrated in the hole in the center of the coil. The wire turns are often wound around a magnetic core made from a ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic material such as iron; the magnetic core concentrates the magnetic flux and makes a more powerful magnet. The main advantage of an electromagnet over a permanent magnet is that the magnetic field can be quickly changed by controlling the amount of electric current in the winding. However, unlike a permanent magnet that needs no power, an electromagnet requires a continuous supply of current to maintain the magnetic field. Electromagnets are widely used as components of other electrical devices, such as motors, generators, electromechanical solenoids, relays, loudspeakers, hard disks, MRI machines, scientific instruments, and magnetic separation equipment. Electromagnets are also employed in industry for picking up and moving heavy iron objects such as scrap iron and steel.

British scientist William Sturgeon invented the electromagnet in 1824. [3] [4] His first electromagnet was a horseshoe-shaped piece of iron that was wrapped with about 18 turns of bare copper wire ( insulated wire didn't exist yet). The iron was varnished to insulate it from the windings. When a current was passed through the coil, the iron became magnetized and attracted other pieces of iron; when the current was stopped, it lost magnetization. Sturgeon displayed its power by showing that although it only weighed seven ounces (roughly 200 grams), it could lift nine pounds (roughly 4 kilos) when the current of a single-cell battery was applied. However, Sturgeon's magnets were weak because the uninsulated wire he used could only be wrapped in a single spaced out layer around the core, limiting the number of turns. Beginning in 1830, US scientist Joseph Henry systematically improved and popularized the electromagnet. [5] [6] By using wire insulated by silk thread, and inspired by Schweigger 's use of multiple turns of wire to make a galvanometer, [7] he was able to wind multiple layers of wire on cores, creating powerful magnets with thousands of turns of wire, including one that could support 2,063 lb (936 kg). The first major use for electromagnets was in telegraph sounders. The magnetic domain theory of how ferromagnetic cores work was first prop

In 1970, the New Haven Black Panther trials took place, the largest and longest trials in Connecticut history. Black Panther Party co-founder Bobby Seale and ten other Party members were tried for murdering an alleged informant. Beginning on May Day, the city became a center of protest for 12,000 Panther supporters, college students, and New Left activists (including Jean Genet, Benjamin Spock, Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, and John Froines), who amassed on the New Haven Green, across the street from where the trials were being held. Violent confrontations between the demonstrators and the New Haven police occurred, and several bombs were set off in the area by radicals. The event became a rallying point for the New Left and critics of the Nixon Administration.
Wages have not kept pace with inflation since the late 1970's. If they had, minimum wage today would be around $20. productivity and corporate profits are higher than ever before, but that wealth has all been consolidated amongst the top .1% of earners. Because of this, it is no longer possible for most families to survive from one income. Here are some enlightening charts showing this data.  Top earners wages have gone up 138% since 1979, while middle class wages only increased 6%.  _URL_0_

Vyt Bakaitis Vyt Bakaitis (born 1940) is an American translator, editor, and poet born in Lithuania and living in New York City. His first collection of poetry "City Country" (1991) was followed by "Deliberate Proof" (2010). Thirst, the magazine he co-edited with Benjamin Sloan, lasted only a few issues, but his translations of Lithuanian poetry are significant; particularly the 20th-century anthology "Breathing Free" (2001), which he also edited. Three additional volumes he translated from the Lithuanian are by contemporary poets Jonas Mekas and Julius Keleras. He was married to the late artist Sharon Gilbert.
prostration definition : prostration Prostration is the placement of the body in a reverentially or submissively prone position as a gesture. Typically prostration is distinguished from the lesser acts of bowing or kneeling by involving a part of the body above the knee touching the ground, especially the hands. Major world religions employ prostration as an act of submissiveness or worship to a supreme being or other worshiped entities (i.e. God or the gods), as in the sajdah of the Islamic prayer, salat, or to show reverence to persons or other elements of the religion. In various cultures and traditions, prostrations are similarly used to show respect to rulers, civil authorities and social elders or superiors, as in the Chinese kowtow or Ancient Persian proskynesis. The act has often traditionally been an important part of religious, civil and traditional rituals and ceremonies, and remains in use in many cultures.==Traditional religious practices==Many religious institutions (listed alphabetically below) use prostrations to embody the lowering, submitting or relinquishing of the individual ego before a greater spiritual power or presence.===Baha'i Faith=== In the Bahá'í Faith, prostrations are performed as a part of one of the alternatives of obligatory prayer (the "Long" one) and in the case of traveling, a prostration is performed in place of each missed obligatory prayer in addition to saying "Glorified be God, the Lord of Might and Majesty, of Grace and Bounty". However, if unable to do so, saying "Glorified be God" is sufficient. There are specifics about where the prostration can take place including, "God hath granted you leave to prostrate yourselves on any surface that is clean..." (note #10) and "He also condemns such practices as prostrating oneself before another person and other forms of behaviour that abase one individual in relation to another". (note #57)===Buddhism===In Buddhism, prostrations are commonly used and the various stages of the physical movement are traditionally counted in threes and related to the Triple Gem, consisting of: * the Awakened One (Sanskrit/Pali: Buddha) (in this meaning, to own potential) * his teaching (Sanskrit: Dharma; Pali: Dhamma ) * his community ( Sangha) of noble disciples ( ariya-savaka ). In addition, different schools within Buddhism use prostrations in various ways, such as the Tibetan tantric preliminary practice of a 100,000 prostrations as a means of overcoming pride (see Ngöndro). Tibetan pilgrims often progress by prostrating themselves fully at each step, then moving forward as they get up, in such a way that they have lain on their face on each part of their route. Each three paces involves a full prostration; the number three is taken to refer to the Triple Gem. This is often done round a stupa, and in an extremely arduous pilgrimage, Mount Kailash is circumnavigated entirely by this method, which takes about four weeks to complete the 52 kilometre route. It is also not unusual to see pilgrims prostrating all the way from their home to Lhasa, sometimes a distance of over 2000 km, the process taking up to two years to complete.===Christianity=== In Christianity, the Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic and Anglican churches use full prostrations, lying flat on the floor face down, during the imposition of Holy Orders, Religious Profession and the Consecration of Virgins. Additionally, in the Roman Catholic Church at the beginning of the Good Friday Liturgy, the celebrating priest and the deacon prostrate themselves in front of the altar. Dominican practice on Good Friday services in priory churches includes prostration by all friars in the aisle of the church. In the Roman Catholic and Anglican churches, partial prostrations ("profound bows") can be used in place of genuflections for those who are unable to genuflect. The prostration is always performed before God, and in the case of holy orders, profession or consecration the candidates prostrate themselves in front of the altar which is a symbol of Christ. Lesser prostrations, lit., "low bows" ( zemnoy pok

The entire park lies at an elevation of more than above mean sea level. The National Park was inscribed a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988. The latter was expanded and renamed to Nanda Devi and Valley of Flowers National Parks in 2005. Within the National Park lies the "Nanda Devi Sanctuary", a glacial basin surrounded by a ring of
In turn, according to Kozinski's analysis, the contemporary rule of binding precedent became possible in the U.S. in the nineteenth century only after the creation of a clear court hierarchy (under the Judiciary Acts), and the beginning of regular verbatim publication of U.S. appellate decisions by West Publishing. The rule gradually developed, case-by-case, as an extension of the judiciary's public policy of effective judicial administration (that is, in order to efficiently exercise the judicial power). The rule of precedent is generally justified today as a matter of public policy, first, as a matter of fundamental fairness, and second, because in the absence of case law, it would be completely unworkable for every minor issue in every legal case to be briefed, argued, and decided from first principles (such as relevant statutes, constitutional provisions, and underlying public policies), which in turn would create hopeless inefficiency, instability, and unpredictability, and thereby undermine the rule of law.

Top 7 Companies Owned by Home Depot (HD) Top 7 Companies Owned by Home Depot (HD)By David Gorton August 24, 2016 — 1:00 PM EDTAs a worldwide leader in providing home improvement goods, The Home Depot Inc. (NYSE: HD) has a diversified chain of products and locations. Through acquisitions and brand development, it carries numerous items for sale in areas all around the world. Although Home Depot’s main acquisition period occurred in the 2000s, it made a $1.63 billion acquisition in July 2015 that further solidified itself as a global industry leader. The company, which recently reported a market capitalization of almost $170 billion, experiences success, in part, due to the subsidiaries that it owns. Home Decorators Collection In 2006, Home Depot agreed to buy Home Decorators Collection, a leader in catalog as well as online sales of home decor items. The acquisition doubled the size of Home Depot’s direct-to-consumer business, as the new company operates out of the Home Depot Direct division. Home Decorators Collection had the third-largest house file in the catalog industry at the time of the deal and increased its catalog with 65,000 new home decor products. Home Mart In 2004, Home Depot doubled its presence in Mexico through the acquisition of Home Mart Mexico. Home Mart was the country’s second-largest home improvement chain behind Home Depot. It operated 20 stores in Mexico, and after the deal, Home Depot had 39 stores in central and northern Mexico. The key piece of the deal was the 10 new stores in metropolitan Mexico City, as Home Depot previously had only three stores in the area. Home Mart was established in 1993, and the financial sum paid to the group of private Mexican owners was not disclosed. Interline Brands The world’s largest home improvement retailer completed a $1.63 billion acquisition of Interline Brands, Inc., a leading national distributor and direct marketer of maintenance, repair and operations products. Interline’s extensive local distribution network of more than 90 locations across the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico allowed for the delivery of its maintenance, repair and operations products. Headquartered in Florida, Interline serves more than 175,000 customer locations and holds market presence in institutional, multi-family housing and residential markets. The deal boosted Home Depot’s Pro division that caters to professional contractors and builders. The Home Way Home Depot, as part of its global expansion strategy, entered Chinese markets through its acquisition of The Home Way. The Home Way, a home improvement retailer founded in 1996, is based in Tianjin. Its 12 stores, averaging 90,000 square feet of selling space, were located in six Chinese cities. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Your Other Warehouse Home Depot purchased a master distributor of faucets, fixtures, bath accessories and kitchen accessories called Your Other Warehouse. Based in Baton Rouge, with a second facility in Las Vegas, Your Other Warehouse was a Home Depot vendor prior to the purchase. It distributes faucets, sinks, accessories and commercial fixtures. The company also retails exclusive brands. Home Depot’s motivation for the deal was to expand its wholesale plumbing industry presence. As part of the deal, Home Depot received the mailing list of 3.3 million customers of Home Decorators Collection, which is headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri. The financial details of the acquisition were not released to the public. Exclusive Brands In addition to owning multiple companies, Home Depot owns exclusive rights to earn retail sales from several major brands. Founded in 1977, Chem-Dry was purchased by the company in 2006. It is a carpet-cleaning franchise based in Utah. Behr Process Corporation manufactures house paints, primers, stains and surface preparation products sold exclusively at Home Depot. Homelite Corporation is a power equipment manufacturer of chainsaws, leaf blowers and trimmers that are sold at Home Depot. House Brands Home Depot also owns various house brands. Husky is a manuf

Nobody knows the answer. There are predictions, but they are all extrapolations. Those are the least reliable kind of predictions. In the long term, there will be very slightly more CO2 in the atmosphere. This will change the climate in many small ways, bigger storms, ocean current shifts, less polar ice and higher ocean levels. The magnitude of these effects is much less certain. Also, to foretell the future 100 years out one would need to know what humanity does. That's absolutely unknowable, given free will. Asking "if we do nothing" is ridiculous, as this is among the least likely courses of action. Generally, humans wait for things to get bad and then do something about it. The best guesses probably look something like that.

History of Bolivia the establishment of the Bolivian Republic, named for the Liberator Simón Bolívar, on August 6, 1825. Since then Bolivia has endured regular periods of political and economic instability, including the loss of various provinces to its neighbors, such as Acre, parts of the Gran Chaco and its Pacific coast, making it a land-locked country. Cultures of indigenous peoples in Bolivia developed in the high altitude settings of altiplano with low oxygen levels, poor soils and extreme weather patterns. The better suited lowlands were sparsely inhabited by hunter-gatherer societies while much of the pre-Columbian population was concentrated in altiplano valleys of

How Often Do Dogs Need the Parvo Vaccine? Dog Health How Often Do Dogs Need the Parvo Vaccine?by Bethney Foster Labradors, rottweilers, doberman pinschers, American Staffordshire terriers and German shepherds are more likely to contract parvovirus than other breeds of dogs. Parvo is a life-threatening virus that infects dogs, mainly puppies. It is highly contagious and attacks the dog's intestinal tract and white blood cells and can even damage the heart. A series of three to four vaccinations, followed by annual boosters, are necessary to ensure a puppy is protected. Vaccination Series Your puppy received maternal antibodies that protected his against parvovirus and other diseases. These antibodies wane as the puppy's immune system develops. If the puppy still has antibodies when he is vaccinated, the antibodies will stop the vaccination from stimulating the immune system to provide protections against the virus. Because no one knows for sure when the maternal antibodies are gone and a vaccination will work, and because this can vary from puppy to puppy, a series of vaccinations are given to young dogs. The hope is that one of these vaccinations will be given after the puppy's body has lost the maternal antibodies, but before the puppy is exposed to the virus. Timing Different veterinarians have different protocols about the timing of vaccinations. Most veterinarians recommend that a puppy receive his first parvovirus vaccination when he is 8 weeks old. The second vaccination is given in three to four weeks, about age 11 to 12 weeks. A third vaccination is given in three to four more weeks, about age 14 to 15 weeks. A vaccination is sometimes given three to four weeks later, about age 17 to 18 weeks. Most all veterinarians agree the final vaccination in the series should be given after the puppy is 4 months old. Once the puppy series is complete, your dog should received a booster vaccination each year. Administration The vaccination for parvovirus is administered through an injection. While it may sound as if your puppy is going to get stuck a lot in his early months, don't worry. The parvovirus vaccination is administered through an injection that is given under the puppy's skin, but doesn't go into the muscle. Most puppies don't even notice it is being given. Side effects associated with the parvovirus vaccination are rare. When your puppy gets his first parvo vaccination, your veterinarian will probably ask you to wait for a few minutes to be sure your puppy doesn't have an allergic reaction. Less serious side effects can include a low-grade fever, lethargy and decreased appetite for a few days. Limiting Exposure Because parvovirus is contagious, it is best you limit your puppy's exposure until he has completed the entire series of vaccinations. This means not taking your puppy to the pet supply store, dog park or even the groomer until after the vaccination series is complete. Areas where large numbers of dogs gather are the most likely environments to be contaminated. It is even a good idea to carry your puppy when you go to the veterinarian. It's possible a dog infected with parvovirus just walked across the lobby floor. Most obedience schools, puppy kindergartens and other such programs will not accept puppies until the vaccination series is complete. This is for your puppy's protection as well as the protection of the other dogs.

Shared doctrines would include beliefs about one God; the virgin birth; miracles; atonement for sins through the death, burial, and bodily resurrection of Jesus; the Trinity; the need for salvation (through belief in Jesus Christ as the son of God, his death and resurrection, and confession of Christ as Lord); grace; the Kingdom of God; last things (eschatology) (Jesus Christ will return personally and visibly in glory to the earth, the dead will be raised, and Christ will judge everyone in righteousness); and evangelism and missions. Some historically significant Baptist doctrinal documents include the 1689 London Baptist Confession of Faith, 1742 Philadelphia Baptist Confession, the 1833 New Hampshire Baptist Confession of Faith, the Southern Baptist Convention's Baptist Faith and Message, and written church covenants which some individual Baptist churches adopt as a statement of their faith and beliefs.
No. The size of atoms depends on a few fundamental physical constants. You can look at the formula for the [Bohr radius](_URL_0_) to see this: a*_0_* = hbar/(m*_e_*\*c\*alpha) On the right hand side you have the Planck constant, the mass of the electron, the speed of light, and the fine structure constant. To the best that we can determine, none of those constants have changed since the beginning of the universe (and there have been serious attempts to look for these changes by observing very distant objects).  So atoms were the same size for as long as the four fundamental interactions (strong, weak, E & M, and gravity) have existed. The expanding universe just provides more space for the matter to move around in.

Dog-cow Hybrids It being produced by Linaria seems to us no less monstrous than a calf with a wolf’s head being produced by a cow. —Carl Linnaeus Nova acta eruditorum 1760, p. 409Caution: The many eyewitness reports quoted below, have not as yet been confirmed by molecular genetic tests. An alleged dog-cow hybrid birthed by a cow in 2011. Enlarge A second view of the alleged dog-cow cross. Enlarge View of same animal as above, showing the interior of the mouth. Enlarge T his article began as an account of a hybrid birth that allegedly occurred in Indonesia in 2011, but which seems never to have made the news here in the United States. That particular event is described in what immediately follows, the portion of this page that was written first. However, subsequent searches for other records about hybrids of this type revealed many additional, eyewitness reports, which are quoted lower down on this page, after the account of the Indonesian case. According to Indonesian-, Malay- and Arabic-language news reports and blogs, on February 2nd of that year, a cow on the island of Madura, off the northeastern coast of Java, gave birth to a creature (pictured at right) that created widespread excitement and, given that cattle are often accorded sacred status in eastern Asia, even religious awe. The owner, described in the various articles as the “farmer Misnoto” (also pictured at right), is a resident of the hamlet of Katuje in the Gate District of Sumenep, Madura. He told reporters that the “calf” was born early that Wednesday morning via normal processes and that he and his neighbors were all surprised when they saw its dog-like face. The various reports seem not to identify the type of cow that served as maternal parent, but Maduran farmers do not keep European domestic cattle ( Bos taurus ), so the mother would most likely have been either a banteng cow ( Bos javanicus ), shown below at right, or a cow of the Madura breed ( Bos javanicus × Bos indicus ). Several of the articles, translated into English with the Google translator, say that the male parent was a wolf. However, the word wolf is likely an artifact of the automated translation. For even if a canid-bovid cross were possible — and it is unknown whether such crosses might rarely occur — it seems highly unlikely that a wolf ( Canis lupus) would be present at the locale in question to perform the requisite mating, let alone to produce such a hybrid (unless it were perhaps a pet, or a wolf in a zoo). C. lupus is not native to Indonesia. The only possibility for a canid sire, then, would be domestic dog. Unlike wolves, dogs are notorious for their willingness to mate with almost any type of animal. For example, male dogs have been observed mating with ducks, geese and chickens (see the section on dog hybrids elsewhere on this website). A video showing a male dog mating with a cow at right above. Gape of a thylacine, an extinct carnivore As the photos show, this animal, which is male, is a very strange-looking creature. In particular, it has a huge mouth opening, as do many carnivores. Cattle and most herbivores have relatively small mouth openings. In this bizarre “calf,” the mouth opening reaches almost to the ears. It also has a lolling tongue like a dog. Also dog-like is the loose fur on the breast visible in the middle photo. Perhaps it’s just my imagination, but there’s something about its winsome expression in the middle picture that reminds me of my own dog in some of his more relaxed and satisfied moments. Cow’s dental pad. ( Enlarge )However, as can be seen in the enlarged version of the lowermost photo, this animal has no upper incisors. Instead, there is a dental pad at the front of the upper jaw, as in cattle (see picture at right). The lower incisors, clearly visible in the enlargement of the middle picture, are cow-like. However, in the uppermost photo (also enlargeable) the erupting molars seem to be pointed like the carnassials of a dog, instead of flat like a cow’s. The lower jaw is much shorter than the upper and, according to the news reports, the mout

Ask an Expert: Do Heating Pads After a Workout Help Reduce Muscle Soreness? Some like it hot- specifically sore muscles. We asked our Fitness Expert Kristy Wilson to share how heat helps alleviate post-workout pains. Expert's Take Kristy Wilson, NSCA, NASM: Whether you're just starting to exercise or are a bona fide gym rat, post-workout soreness is bound to happen once in awhile; especially when starting a new exercise program. Soreness is the body's response to adapting to something new. It is a normal reaction to unusual exertion. However, feeling sore after a workout isn't a measure of effectiveness. There are lots of factors that can come into play including the quality of the warm up and cool down, intensity of the workout, pre and post-workout nutrition, and even how much you've slept. Post-workout muscle soreness is commonly referred to as DOMS- delayed onset muscle soreness. After finishing a workout we may feel a little tired, but over the next 12-24 hours the soreness sets in. When we exercise we are placing stress on our muscles, actually causing small microscopic tears (this is a good thing since it leads to a stronger regrowth!). Along with inflammation, these cause the muscle soreness and discomfort known as DOMS. Rule of thumb: when it comes to sprains and pains use ice, but heat when it's muscles that are sore. (Ice is better for acute injuries, especially if there is swelling and bruising. You can also use ice on sore muscles in the acute stage. But for chronic muscle soreness lasting more than a few days, heat is better. )To reduce soreness, take a long, relaxing soak in a warm bath (bonus points for adding epsom salt). But since bath time at work isn't a viable option, try using a heating pad. Heat helps warm our muscles, increasing blood flow to the area. Heating pads ease muscle soreness by applying low heat, directly to the source of pain. Leave on for about 20 minutes, and be sure to place a towel between the pad and skin to avoid potential burns. If soreness persists after 7 days or sudden, severe muscle pain is felt, consult a doctor. THE NEWSLETTERTired? Sign up for our newsletter to get the sleep cheat sheet you desperately need.

In principle, the US taxes both income and gifts. Simply thinking good thoughts is not necessarily sufficient to avoid filing or payment obligations. Giving somebody money with no repayment date, no interest, and no enforceable note looks an awful lot like either income or a gift. A loan normally has interest, money sitting in a savings account is insured, and other investments generally have an expected return.  Why would somebody give a loan with no interest, with only flexible or informal payment expectations, in a way where it has neither deposit insurance nor any expectation of net returns?  That looks a lot like a gift - at the very least, a gift of the time value and the default risk. The IRS definitely polices loan rates. The latest release is Revenue Ruling 2014-13. The AFR is useful for tax concepts such as Original Issue Discount (when issuers sell low-interest or no-interest bonds or loans at less than face value, attempting to recharacterize interest income as return of principal), various grantor trusts (e.g. GRATs), and so forth.  It's a simple way for the IRS to link to market rates of interest. Documentation and sufficient interest, as well as clear payment schedule (and maybe call or demand rights) make it a bona fide loan.  There is no real way for the IRS to distinguish between an informal arrangement and a post-hoc lie to conceal a gift.  Moreover, an undocumented loan is generally difficult to enforce, so it looks less like a true loan. The lender declares the interest payments as income on his Form 1040, line 8a and if necessary Schedule B.

. The Iron Curtain Divided Europe and Berlin During the time I was in Germany, Europe was divided by the "Iron Curtain." Intense Communism controlled the lives of people in the countries to the east of the iron curtain, contrasted with freedom in countries to the west. The above map shows a proposed tourist trail along where the Iron Curtain once stood. Germany was split by the "Iron Curtain," with Communist East Germany (Deutsche Demokratische Republik) [in orange color] on one side and free West Germany (Bundesrepublik Deutschland) [in purple color] on the other side. Berlin was stuck in the middle of Communist East Germany. It was an island of freedom in a sea of communism, but the city of Berlin itself was also split in half. At the end of World War II, Berlin (Germany's capital city) was divided into four zones. West Berlin consisted of the American, British, and French zones. East Berlin was the Soviet Union's zone. West Berlin became a popular way for people behind the iron curtain to escape communism. They would enter communist East Berlin and then cross into West Berlin and apply for refugee status. Then they flew out of West Berlin to freedom in Western countries. During the summer of 1961the flow of thousands of refugees per day became so intense that the communists were forced to take drastic action. On August 13, 1961 they closed the borders around West Berlin and began to build a wall through the middle of the city of Berlin. They also surrounded the rest of West Berlin with a concentration-camp-like fence with armed guard towers. On September 24, 1961 the Berliner Morgenpost tried to describe their plight to Americans. It published a front-page drawing of the United States with a similar "iron curtain" splitting America down the Mississippi River and dividing New York City into two halves, the eastern half being communist and the western half being free. The headline was directed at retired American General Lucius D. Clay, who was especially beloved by the people of Berlin. As the Military Governor of Germany after World War II, he thwarted a Soviet blockade of Berlin by the Berlin Airlift of 1948 - 1949. In 1961, he became President John F. Kennedy's special representative in Berlin. The newspaper reads: "General Clay! What would your countrymen say if......if the U. S. A. were torn and the eastern part of the country groaned under the whip of a foreign rule?...if New York lay in a red [e.g. communist] sea, a divided city in which a son could not go to his dying mother?...if the freedom of several million New Yorkers was bought with the betrayal of Georgia, Virginia and Ohio?...if the allies of the U. S. A. decided that the American people should forego their unity?" [ Top ] [ Back] [ Home] 
Which subatomic particles are located in the nucleus of a carbon atom? The subatomic particles in the nucleus of a carbon atom are protons and neutrons. The atomic nucleus contains protons and usually neutrons (except for hydrogen-1 (protium) atoms. The number of protons is an element's atomic number and is the same for all atoms of an element. Carbon has atomic number #6#. So all atoms of carbon have #6# protons in their atomic nuclei.
The James Bond gadget that turns you into a FISH: Concept mask lets you breathe underwater without oxygen tanks The James Bond gadget that turns you into a FISH: Concept mask lets you breathe underwater without oxygen tanks Concept gadget has arms which branch out to the side and work as gills Material on these two arms conceal tiny holes where water is sucked in Chambers inside separate the oxygen and release the water so that the user can breathe continuously while swimming By Dailymail.com Reporter Published: 10:33 EDT, 16 January 2014 | Updated: 11:41 EDT, 6 April 2016297View comments It’s the James Bond gadget on everyone’s wishlist. The rebreather, a system that lets you breathe underwater, has got Mr Bond out of some tricky situations. Now one South Korean designer Korea has taken inspiration from the spy’s device to create a concept gadget that claims to instantly transform the user into a human fish.+7The mask, dubbed Triton, acts like a fish gill to extract oxygen from water so that the user can keep on breathing while under the sea HOW TRITON COULD WORKTo use Triton, swimmers would bite down on a plastic mouth piece. Two arms, which branch out to the sides of the scuba mask, have been developed to function as gills. The scaly texture on the arms conceals small holes in the material where water is sucked in. Chambers inside separate the oxygen and release the liquid so that the user can breathe comfortably in the ocean. Using a very small but powerful micro compressor, the system compresses oxygen and stores it in tanks. The gadget is powered by micro battery around 30 times smaller than a battery. The device, however, is only a concept and questions remain over whether it would be technically feasible to recreate. The mask, dubbed Triton, acts like a fish gill to extract oxygen from water so that the user can keep on breathing while under the sea. While it may not be as slick as a rebreather, designer Jeabyun Yeon, who came up with the concept, believes it will change the way people approach water. To use Triton, swimmers would bite down on a plastic mouth piece. Two arms, which branch out to the sides of the scuba mask, can then function as efficient gills to deliver oxygen. The scaly texture on the arms conceal small holes in the material where water is sucked in. Chambers inside separate the oxygen and release the liquid so that the user can breathe comfortably in the ocean. Using a very small but powerful micro compressor, the concept system would compress oxygen and store it in tanks. The entire gadget is powered by micro battery which is around 30 times smaller than a current battery that can quickly charge 1,000 times faster. But you may have to wait a little longer before placing an order as the product is still at concept stage. Mr Yeon describes it as ‘a future product’ that could one day replace complicated scuba equipment. RELATED ARTICLESPrevious 1 Next A bright idea! Genetically engineered plant glows so...

What is your reason for asking? If you scanned with AVG and it reported FCL_DLL.dll to be a source of infection (Win32/Heur), I only know to tell you it has done so in the past. It was a confirmed false positive. This is not the first time the question has been asked. As far back as 2007 some were reporting files related to Cyberlink's Power DVD to be infected. Most were false positives. Some scanners detected an Aurora file. IF present and IF from Direct Revenue, it's considered adware. To the best of my knowledge. these instances were few and far between. More recently, certain Norton products were reporting RIKVM 38F51D56.sys to be a rootkit. More often than not .. Norton Power Eraser. The following is noted in a thread titled " Is this a virus RIKVM_38F51D56. SYS ? at the Norton Community Forum: 'It is a legitimate Cyberlink file. Norton Power Eraser is more aggressive than the regular Norton security products and possible false positives are something you need to be aware of when using the product. You always need to verify that the items NPE suggests to remove, are, in fact, malicious.' The original poster also posted at the Cyberlink Forum. ( Is RIKVM_38F51D56. SYS a legit Power DVD file or a virus?) The Cyberlink Administrator indicated it was a false positive. Lastly.. and only my opinion. I found the thread at the Norton forum here. The site which purports the file to be a rootkit, I find unreliable and highly suspect. Putting aside the fact they've spammed our forums, see what those at Web of Trust (WOT) have to report about the site. If the reason you asked is because you were considering installing it and IF.. AVG has a problem with it, I would suggest uploading the file/s to Virus Total or another service which analyzes suspicious files. With hopes this was.. "enough lights shed"...

The simple answer is because the financial markets are run by people, and people don't like to work 7 days a week.  You also have to look at it as you would any business. Financial markets are very expensive to run, so while it's certainly *possible* to keep markets open 24/7, doing so would be very inefficient. Stock markets are open during regular "business hours" to make the best use of their time. For example, it's the same reason that some restaurants only open at 4pm, because the owners have found that they don't get enough customers at lunchtime to justify opening early. If there were a strong demand for weekend trading, I'm sure the markets would be open all week, but for now it isn't necessary so they don't do it.

Its like the old selling food stamps. Some people get the strips for free and sell them for the cash. The buyer then sells them to people that don't get them for free at a discounted price. People used to do this with foodstamps. They would pay you 50 cents on the dollar or whatever and the person with food stamps could go buy their beer or drugs with the cash. Food stamps are free and you can only buy certain things. Well that was the case but now you can just go to the ATM and get the cash and go buy your beer and drugs.

Organised unions are the closest thing the working class have to representation in government. Unions have been roundly villified and diminished in the last 30 years thanks to laissez fare economics and a general social rejection of collective action in favour of individualism. Most of the perks of your job are down to unions and while none are perfect theyre enormously empowering to the majority of us who have the temerity to not own their own company. Some unions may corrupt, some may be incompetent, but without them its only a stone's throw to the workhouse.

There is increasing inclusion and visibility of bisexuals, particularly in the LGBT community.

[6]Contents [ hide ]1 Motivations1.1 Male motivations2 Common examples3 In the LGBT community4 Theoretical analyses and literature4.1 Theoretical frameworks4.1.1 Examples5 Media depictions5.1 Television6 See also7 References8 Further reading9 External links Motivations [ edit]According to scholar Kenji Yoshino, there are three main investments that motivate both self-identified homosexuals and heterosexuals to seek to culturally erase bisexuality. These motivations are firstly, sexual orientation stabilization. This relieves people of the anxiety of having sexual orientation questioned, an untenable position since it is in fact unprovable. There is a belief that bisexuals are simply undecided, and that they are fundamentally homosexual or heterosexual. This isolates, marginalises and makes bisexuals invisible within the community. [7] Secondly, the maintenance of the importance of gender, which is seen as erotically essential to monosexuals while this notion is challenged by the existence of bisexuality. Thirdly, the maintenance of monogamy since for mainstream Americans, a pair bond is preferred. However, bisexuals are generally assumed by monosexuals to be "intrinsically" non-monogamous. [8]In an article written for the 10th anniversary of Yoshino's piece, Heron Greenesmith argues that bisexuality is in fact inherently invisible in the law, beyond the reach of deliberate erasure. Firstly, she says it is because bisexuality is legally irrelevant with plaintiffs presumed to be monosexual unless outed and secondly, that when bisexuality is legally relevant it is erased within the legal culture since it complicates legal arguments that depend on a gender binary nature of sexuality. [9]Male motivations [ edit]Richard C. Friedman, an academic psychiatrist who specializes in the psychodynamics of homosexuality, writes in his essay "Denial in the Development of Homosexual Men" that many gay men have experienced sexual fantasies about women or engaged in heterosexual sex and that many straight men have experienced sexual fantasies about men or engaged in homosexual sex. Despite being bisexual in fantasy and activity, these men identify as "gay" or "straight" rather than as bisexual. This erasure of bisexuality is sometimes caused by denying the significance of an erotic encounter in order to maintain a person's sexual identity and sense of community; a man might downplay having had sexual fantasies or encounters with a woman in order to maintain his identity as a "gay man" and his membership in the gay community, or a man might downplay having had sexual fantasies or encounters with a man in order to maintain his status as a heterosexual ma
Raines law Raines law The Raines law, authored by John Raines, was passed on March 23, 1896, by the New York State Legislature. It was nominally a liquor tax, but its intention was to curb the consumption of alcohol by imposing regulations. Among other provisions, it prohibited the sale of alcoholic beverages on Sunday except in hotels. Most men worked a six-day week, and Sunday was the only full day for drinking at saloons. Under the law, however, hotels were allowed to serve liquor on Sunday, to guests only, if it was served during a meal or in the bedrooms of the
St Helena has long been known for its high proportion of endemic birds and vascular plants. The highland areas contain most of the 400 endemic species recognised to date. Much of the island has been identified by BirdLife International as being important for bird conservation, especially the endemic Saint Helena plover or wirebird, and for seabirds breeding on the offshore islets and stacks, in the north-east and the south-west Important Bird Areas. On the basis of these endemics and an exceptional range of habitats, Saint Helena is on the United Kingdom's tentative list for future UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

Credit: Iowa State In recent years, scientists have decoded the DNA of humans and a menagerie of creatures but none with genes as complex as a stalk of corn, the latest genome to be unraveled. A team of scientists led by The Genome Center at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis published the completed corn genome in the Nov. 20 journal Science, an accomplishment that will speed efforts to develop better crop varieties to meet the world's growing demands for food, livestock feed and fuel. "Seed companies and maize geneticists will pounce on this data to find their favorite genes," says senior author Richard K. Wilson, Ph. D., director of Washington University's Genome Center, who led the multi-institutional sequencing effort. "Now they'll know exactly where those genes are. Having the complete genome in hand will make it easier to breed new varieties of corn that produce higher yields or are more tolerant to extreme heat, drought, or other conditions. "Corn, also known as maize, is the top U. S. crop and the basis of products ranging from breakfast cereal to toothpaste, shoe polish and ethanol. The corn genome is a hodgepodge of some 32,000 genes crammed into just 10 chromosomes. In comparison, humans have 20,000 genes dispersed among 23 chromosomes. The $29.5 million maize sequencing project began in 2005 and is funded by the National Science Foundation and the U. S. departments of agriculture and energy. The genome was sequenced at Washington University's Genome Center. The overall effort involved more than 150 U. S. scientists with those at the University of Arizona in Tucson, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York and Iowa State University in Ames playing key roles. The group sequenced a variety of corn known as B73, developed at Iowa State decades ago. It is known for its high grain yields and has been used extensively in both commercial corn breeding and in research laboratories. The genetic code of corn consists of 2 billion bases of DNA, the chemical units that are represented by the letters T, C, G and A, making it similar in size to the human genome, which is 2.9 billion letters long. But that's where much of the similarity ends. The challenge for Wilson and his colleagues was to string together the order of the letters, an immense and daunting task both because of the corn genome's size and its complex genetic arrangements. About 85 percent of the DNA segments are repeated. Jumping genes, or transposons, that move from place to place make up a significant portion of the genome, further complicating sequencing efforts. A working draft of the maize genome, unveiled by the same group of scientists in 2008, indicated the plant had 50,000-plus genes. But when they placed the many thousands of DNA segments onto chromosomes in the correct order and closed the remaining gaps, the researchers revised the number of genes to 32,000. "Sequencing the corn genome was like driving down miles and miles of desolate highway with only sporadically placed sign posts," says co-investigator Sandra Clifton, Ph. D., of Washington University. "We had a rudimentary map to guide us, but because of the repetitive nature of

Croatian phrasebook Croatian phrasebook Book a Hotel In Out Check Rates Croatian is a Slavic language spoken by around 7 million people. It is the official language of Croatia and one of the official languages of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It also is an official regional language in the province of Burgenland in Austria. It has three main dialects: Chakavian, spoken primarily on the islands, along the Croatian coast and in the Lika region, Kajkavian, spoken in northern and northwestern Croatia, and Štokavian, spoken in the rest of Croatia. This phrasebook gives an overview of useful phrases in Standard Croatian. Croatian belongs to the "synthetic" language group, which means that unlike English and other "analytical" languages, different grammatical aspects are expressed in one word by changing the structure of that word—adding an ending or prefix, modifying the core of the word, etc. In analytical languages such as English, the same is achieved by using separate auxiliary verbs, pronouns or adjectives while the actual word remains unchanged. In Croatian, one word is often sufficient to express what English can achieve only by using multiple words. Pronunciation [ edit]Croatian uses the Latin alphabet. The spelling of Croatian is largely phonetic so most words are written exactly as they are pronounced. However, there are quite a few exceptions. Those words that are written in capitals signify the stress of the word. Vowels [ edit]alike 'u' in "sun"elike 'e' in "their"ilike 'ee' in "free"olike 'o' in "orb"uapproximately like 'oo' in "soon"Unfortunately, neither stresses (which can fall at any syllable) nor vowel lengths are marked in the written language, but the stress is more predictable than in Russian or Bulgarian, where it is almost obligatory to put an accent on the stressed syllable. Unlike Bulgarian, Russian and other East Slavic languages, however, wrongly pronounced vowel length will seldom cause misunderstanding. In practice, the second-last or third-last syllable is almost always stressed.

In this paper, we present a novel approach for mining opinions from product reviews, where it converts opinion mining task to identify product features, expressions of opinions and relations between them. By taking advantage of the observation that a lot of product features are phrases, a concept of phrase dependency parsing is introduced, which extends traditional dependency parsing to phrase level. This concept is then implemented for extracting relations between product features and expressions of opinions. Experimental evaluations show that the mining task can benefit from phrase dependency parsing.

S. State Tollways← IL 84 IL 89 →Interstate 88 ( I-88) is a tolled Interstate Highway in the US state of Illinois that runs from an interchange with I-80 near Silvis and Moline to an interchange with I-290 and I-294 in Hillside, near Chicago. I-88 is 140.60 miles (226.27 km) long. This route is not contiguous to I-88 in New York. Since 2010, all of I-88 has been part of the Chicago–Kansas City Expressway. The highway also runs through the cities of Aurora, Naperville, De Kalb, and Dixon. Contents [ hide ]1 History1.1 Ronald Reagan Memorial Tollway2 Exit list3 References4 External links History [ edit]Prior to its designation as an Interstate Highway, the route was known as IL 5, and before that, IL 190. The reason for I-88's original designation and continued existence as an Interstate has to do with a technicality in the old National Maximum Speed Law (NMSL). Originally passed in 1973, NMSL was amended in 1987 to permit 65 mph (105 km/h) speed limits on rural stretches of Interstate Highways only. Even though IL 5 was fully up to Interstate standards, it still had to carry a 55 mph (90 km/h) limit because of this wording in NMSL. The Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) and Illinois State Toll Highway Authority (ISTHA) petitioned the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) to re-designate IL 5 as an Interstate, and in 1987, AASHTO approved the request and assigned the Interstate 88 numbering to the highway. [1] NMSL would be completely repealed only eight years later in 1995, but the I-88 shields remain up to this day, even though Illinois 110 shields are being posted throughout the entire Illinois I-88, since it is now part of the Chicago to Kansas City Expressway project, bannered with special "CKC" logos. Ronald Reagan Memorial Tollway in Naperville, heading east Ronald Reagan Memorial Tollway [ edit]The Ronald Reagan Memorial Tollway, originally known as the East-West Tollway, is a toll road in northern Illinois. Opened November 21, 1958, it was initially designated as U. S. Route 30 Toll, and later Illinois Route 190. The original routing extended from the Interstate 294 interchange near Hillside to Illinois Route 47 near Sugar Grove. Illinois Route 56 was overlapped on the East-West Tollway between North Aurora and Sugar Grove in 1965. Map of the Ronald Reagan Memorial Tollway, the tolled portion of Interstate 88When the East-West Tollway was extended to Dixon, Illinois in the 1970s, the Illinois 190 numbering was removed from the stretch between Aurora and Sugar Grove, making that section strictly Illinois 56. Once complete, the new routing of the combined tollway and freeway between Interstate 80 near the Quad Cities and Interstate 294 became designated as Illinois Route 5. In the late 1980s, it was renumbered as Interstate 88. Officially, the tollway portion begins in Rock Falls, IL, starting at the intersection with U. S. Route 30 at mile marker 44, although the first toll plaza does not appear until after the Illinois Route 26 interchange in Dixon, making the section between US 30 and Illinois 26 technically a freeway. It continues as a tollway until its terminus in Hillside. West of U. S. 30 to Interstate 80, Interstate 88 is a freeway. The tollway portion is 96 miles (154 km) long. After the death of Illinois native and former President Ronald Reagan in 2004, the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority voted to rename the toll roadway "Ronald Reagan Memorial Tol

As a cell increases in size, it usually does not make extra copies of DNA. If a cell became too large, an "information crisis" would occur. The cell has more trouble moving enough nutrients and wastes across the cell membrane. The rate at which food, oxygen, and water enter the cell, as well as wast products leave the cell, depends on the surface area of the cell and the cell's volume. If a cell gets too large, it would be more difficult to get sufficient amounts of oxygen and nutrients in and waste products out.2. a) Describe what is meant by each of the following terms: cell volume, cell surface area, ratio of surface area to volume Cell volume is the amount of space the cell occupies and is found by multiplying the length of the cell by the width and by the height fo the cell. Cell surface area is the area of all the sides of the cell added together. It is the total area of the outside of the cell. The ratio of surface area to volume is the division of the surface area of the cell by the volume of the cell. If a cell had a volume of eight and a surface arfea of 24 then the ratio of surface area to volume ratio would be 24/8 or 3.2. b) As a cell increases in size, which increases more rapidly, its surface area or its volume? As a cell increases in size the volume of the cell increases more rapidly than the surface area.2. c) How is a cell's potential growth affected by its ratio of surface area to volume? As the cell increases in size the volume of the cell increases more rapidly than the surface area which causes a decrease in the cell's ratio of surface area to volume and makes it more difficult for the cell to move needed materials in and waste products out. If a cell gets too large, it would be more difficult to get sufficient amounts of oxygen and nutrients in and waste products out, so the cell has to stop growing before this happens.3. Describe how cell division solves the problems of cell growth. Cell division solves the problems of cell growth because cell division keeps the cells from getting too large but allows the organism enough cells to survive. Because of cell division the cells that die can me made up for and the cells work more efficiently.4. Summarize what happens during the process of cell division. In cell division, a cell copies its DNA, divides the nucleus, separates the sister chromatids, and then splits into two daughter cells.5. What is the relationship between interphase and cell division? Interphase is the time between cell divisions during which growth and preparation for division occurs. Interphase happens between every cell division and is not a part of the actual splitting of the cell.6. Name the main events of the cell cycle and discuss the relative length of the major events. The main events of the cell cycle are G1 phase, S phase, G2 phase, (these are all parts of interphase) prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase, and cytokinesis (these last five are M phase). Prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase are all in mitosis. Interphase is the longest part of the cell cycle; cell division is only a small part. S phase is the longest phase of interphase and G2 phase is the shortest of the three phases of interphase. The longest phase of mitosis is prophase and it takes up 50 to 60% of the total time required to complete mitosis. Metaphase only lasts a few minutes.7. Summarize what happens during interphase. During interphase cells grow and prepare for the cell cycle. The cell grows and makes new proteins and organelles, chromosomes are replicated to make another copy of the DNA, and many organelles and molecules required for cell division are produced.8. Explain how the following terms are related to one another: DNA centromere chromo

DEFINITION of 'Accounting Valuation' DEFINITION of 'Accounting Valuation'Accounting valuation is the process of valuing a company's assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes. Several accounting-valuation methods are used while preparing financial statements in order to value assets. Many valuation methods are stipulated by accounting rules, such as the need to use an accepted options model to value the options that a company grants to employees. Other assets are valued simply by the price paid, such as real estate. Typically, fixed assets are valued at the historical price. Marketable securities are valued at the current market price. Next Up Valuation Analysis Historic Pricing Terminal Value - TVRich Valuation BREAKING DOWN 'Accounting Valuation'Accounting valuation is important because the value of assets on a company's financial statements needs to be reliable. Analysis of this valuation is just as important as the valuation itself. Some assets, such as real estate, which is carried at cost less depreciation, can be carried on the balance sheet at far from their true value. Securities the firm owns for its own investment portfolio versus trading will have their own rules for valuation as well, as will bonds held for investment or trading. The updated quarterly or yearly information is made available in the form of financial statements and can be found in the investor relations area of most publicly trading firms' websites.

Some of the disappearances involve a level of mystery which is often popularly explained by a variety of theories beyond human error or acts of nature, attributed by some to the paranormal, a suspension of the laws of physics, or activity by extraterrestrial beings.

Popular interest in the idea continues, however, reflecting the irrepressible human yearning to fathom that which lies beyond the external, physical world and interact with the realms of the imagination and spirit. The Triangle area The area of the Triangle varies with the authors. The legends of the Bermuda Triangle do not come from one primary source, but rather are a continuance of an older tradition of stories passed on orally before being written down. Consequently the reports are subject to any number of cultural perspectives, making it is impossible to pinpoint its exact dimensions. The most common representation is an isosceles triangle that stretches from Miami, Florida, to San Juan, Puerto Rico; and the mid-Atlantic island of Bermuda, with most of the accidents concentrated along the southern boundary around the Bahamas and the Florida Straits. Another popular theory is that it is more of a trapezium covering the Straits of Florida, the Bahamas, and the entire Caribbean island area east to the Azores. Occasionally, the Gulf of Mexico is added under this theory. Beyond the exact geographical boundaries, the general area of the Atlantic, Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico have been heavily-sailed shipping lanes since Christopher Columbus led the way for the European involvement of the New World. From colonial trade ships to the modern day, ships cross through the triangle waters daily for ports in the Americas and Europe, as well as the Caribbean Islands. Cruise ships are also plentiful, and pleasure craft regularly go back and forth between Florida and the islands. It is also a heavily flown route for commercial and private aircraft heading towards Florida, the Caribbean, and South America from points north. The climate in that area of the ocean can be fairly extreme. The Gulf Stream ocean current flows through the Triangle after leaving the Gulf of Mexico. Sudden storms can and do appear, and in the summer to late fall, the occasional hurricane strikes the area. The combination of heavy maritime traffic and tempestuous weather makes it inevitable that vessels could founder in storms and be lost without a trace—especially before modern telecommunications, radar, and satellite technology arrived late in the twentieth century. History of the Triangle story Did you know? The Bermuda Triangle in the Atlantic Ocean, where a number of aircraft and ships are said to have disappeared under mysterious circumstances, is also known as the Devil's Triangle Since humankind began to sail the oceans, there have been stories of cursed waters where ships and people disappear. These disappearances were attributed to everything from vengeful deities, sea serpents, even to the purported edge of the world, when people believed Earth was flat and a ship could fall off the edge. With the advent of modern sailing equipment and techniques, along with scientific understanding of the ocean, much of the maritime lore of earlier days faded away. A few areas remained that became designated as areas of paranormal activity, the mos
For the most part no. Sound travels in waves like light, but they need a material to pass through. The reason you can hear sound on Earth is that vibrations can pass between atoms and molecules and carry sounds through space until they contact your eardrums. In space the concentration of matter is to low to carry sound so you would not be able to hear anything. You could however hear sounds that came from your space suit there would be oxygen and other gasses in your helmet that sound waves could travel through.

The match, however, was largely forgotten as it was overshadowed by England's World Cup victory later that year. The record for most FA Cup wins by a player is held by Ashley Cole, who has won it seven times (with Arsenal in 2002, 2003 and 2005, and Chelsea in 2007, 2009, 2010 and 2012).

There are some demanding uses of computers, where *any* data loss is intolerable. Write-back writes only when necessary or after some interval, but if the power goes off in the meantime, what was in cache is lost. Imagine it like autosaves in games where every 10 minutes it saves. What you did since the last save might be lost. Now in things like banking, data loss of any sort could mean big trouble. Imagine if your direct deposit check was in the middle of being updated in your account and the bank lost power. Might have just lost that transaction! Write-through is more demanding of computer resources, but it's okay because the reduction in potential data loss is more important.
Economic history of Africa and coincided with Germany's sudden emergence as an imperial power. Called for by Portugal and organized by Otto von Bismarck, first Chancellor of Germany, its outcome, the General Act of the Berlin Conference, can be seen as the formalization of the Scramble for Africa. The conference ushered in a period of heightened colonial activity by European powers, while simultaneously eliminating most existing forms of African autonomy and self-governance. During this colonial time, the economy of Africa was re-arranged to serve Europe and Europeans, and the European industrial chain began in Africa and ended in European industrial warehouses.

What is the approximate speed of jet plane in kilmometers per hour? Cars & Transportation Aircraft What is the approximate speed of jet plane in kilmometers per hour? Follow 16 answers Answers Relevance Rating Newest Oldest Best Answer: The passenger jet I travel on goes about 850-900km/hr When you get more answers in M/PH the conversion rate is 1mile=1.6 kmlukumuss · 10 years ago0 0 Comment Depending upon the type of Jet Plane, jets can fly anywhere from about 140 miles per hour and 2 thousand miles per hour. Jets routinely fly in the lower end of the speed range, taking off and landing below 140 miles per hour, and cruising at altitude between 400 and 550 miles per hour. Going faster than that means approaching or breaking through the sound barrier which is not done by the average commercial jet liners and transport (freight) jets. Really fast speeds are accomplished by military jets used for fast attack and ultra high speed reconaissance from high altitudes. Isabella · 2 years ago0 0 Comment The conversion numbers given are from miles per hour to kilometers per hour. Jet aircraft speeds are generally measure in knots (Nautical miles : 1 nautical mile = approx 1.15 statute miles = 1.61 kilometers. What really matters is ground speed-how fast the aircraft is traveling over the ground. At altitude, an aircraft could be flying 300 knots indicated air speed, but have a ground speed of 500 knots. To covert knots to km/h, multiply the speed in knots by 1.85. I fly all the time with an 500 knot ground speed, which translates to 925 km/h.

Who Is Ivana Trump? 11 Facts About Ivanka's Mother And Donald's Ex-Wife Who Is Ivana Trump? 11 Facts About Ivanka's Mother And Donald's Ex-Wife By Cristina Silva @cristymsilva On 07/21/16 AT 9:58 PMIvana Trump arrives at amf AR's Cinema Against AIDS 2006 event in France, May 25, 2006. Photo: Reuters Melania Trump called her husband "intensely loyal to family" during a widely watched speech Monday night at the Republican National Convention. But she isn't his first wife. Of Donald Trump's three marriages, his longest marriage was to Ivana Trump, the mother of his three oldest children. Their daughter, Ivanka Trump, was scheduled to introduce her father Thursday night before he gave his formal presidential nomination acceptance speech. "In a decade of glitz, they were the glitziest; in a decade of greed, they were the greediest: He the scrappy investor who made a fortune wheeling and dealing real estate, she the gregarious, Czech-born outsider who charmed and clawed her way into New York's most refined social circles," People magazine once wrote about their marriage. To truly understand the Trump family dynamics, here are 11 facts about his first first lady.1. Ivana Trump and Donald Trump divorced in 1991 after his much-publicized affair with model Marla Maples, who later became his second wife.2. Ivana Trump claims she told Donald Trump to run for president years ago. "Probably five years before our divorce, Reagan or somebody brought him a letter and said, ‘You should run for president,'" Donald’s first wife told the New York Post. "So he was thinking about it. But then . . . there was the divorce, there was the scandal, and American women loved me and hated him."3. Ivana Trump and Donald Trump are still friendly toward each other.4. She claims she gives him campaign advice. "We speak before and after the appearances and he asks me what I thought," she told the New York Post.5. She grew up in Czechoslovakia, where she was a competitive skier before she became a model.6. She meet Donald Trump at a New York restaurant where she was eating with friends in 1976. He picked up the tab. The couple wed in 1977.7. She had three children with Donald Trump: Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric.8. She often spends time with her ex-husband and sometime lover, Rossano Rubicondi, according to tabloids. He was her fourth husband and they divorced in 2009 after only being married a year.9. She once accused Donald Trump of raping her. She later said she felt "violated." "During a deposition given by me in connection with my matrimonial case, I stated that my husband had raped me," she said. " [O]n one occasion during 1989, Mr. Trump and I had marital relations in which he behaved very differently toward me than he had during our marriage. As a woman, I felt violated, as the love and tenderness, which he normally exhibited towards me, was absent. I referred to this as a ‘rape,’ but I do not want my words to be interpreted in a literal or criminal sense. "She again clarified her feelings on the incident last year: "I have recently read some comments attributed to me from nearly 30 years ago at a time of very high tension during my divorce from Donald. The story is totally without merit. Donald and I are the best of friends and together have raised three children that we love and are very proud of. I have nothing but fondness for Donald and wish him the best of luck on his campaign. Incidentally, I think he would make an incredible president."10. Her divorce from Donald Trump was granted in 1991 because of "cruel and inhuman treatment" of Ivana.11. She allegedly isn't a big fan of Melania Trump. "She can’t talk, she can’t give a speech, she doesn’t go to events, she doesn’t (seem to) want to be involved," she said, according to the New York Daily News in October.

For an object to ignite due to pure friction with the air, it has to be moving *extremely* quickly. Baumgartner simply never reached those speeds. The key phrase is "things from space get burned." They get burned because it is very easy to gain velocity in space due to lack of air resistance. They then carry the kinetic energy from that velocity into the atmosphere and the energy is turned into the friction that causes the burning. Baumgartner jumped from what is called "near space," where there are still gasses that would have been resisting his motion and reducing his downward velocity from the second he jumped. He was never in free fall in the true sense of the word, and thus never even exceeded terminal velocity by much, let alone the speed needed to ignite. [This graph](_URL_0_) sums it up well. Notice how terminal speed is lower the closer he gets to Earth. The gasses were slowing him down the whole way, preventing him from falling fast enough to burn.
Not a physician, but from my past conversations with my med student fiance, it is my understanding the killing cancer cells does not necessarily kill what is causing the cells to mutate. If a random event causes the cells to become cancerous then I believe that killing the cells will kill the cancer. However, if there is an underlying cause of the cells mutating, then you would have to target that problem. Also, there are many different ways that cells can mutate to become cancerous and targeting each and every one of those seems to be fairly difficult.

"Both are saying essentially the same thing.  The Forbes articles says ""as much as 20% [...] up to a maximum of $50,000"".  This means the same as what the IRS page when it says the lesser of a percentage of your income or a total of $53,000.  In other words, the $53k is a cap: you can contribute a percentage of your earnings, but you can never contribute more than $53k, even if you make so much money that 20% of your earnings would be more than that. (The difference between 20% and 25% in the two sources appears to reflect a difference in contribution limits depending on whether you are making contributions for employees, or for yourself as a self-employed individual; see Publication 560.  The difference between $50k and $53k is due to the two pages being written in different years; the limits increase each year.)"

Manitoba's minimum wage jumps a quarter in October Hey there, time traveller! This article was published 18/6/2014 (1393 days ago), so information in it may no longer be current. Manitoba’s minimum wage goes up by 25 cents to $10.70 an hour Oct. 1. Labour and Immigration Minister Erna Braun said in a statement today the increase will be the 14th straight year the minimum wage has gone up.“This most recent increase builds on our long-term plan to provide the lowest wage earners increased purchasing power so they can better provide for themselves and their families," Braun said. The increase of 25 cents per hour brings the current minimum wage to $10.70 from $10.45. It will put Manitoba the fourth-highest among other Canadian jurisdictions. Ontario raised its minimum wage to $11 an hour effective June 1. Saskatchewan will increase its minimum wage from $10 to $10.20 per hour effective Oct. 1.

Historically, animation has been drawn one frame at a time. The primary artists might draw out key frames then hand them off to a group of animators who draw the frames in between. These days, you can have a computer interpolate the from and to and generate the frames in between. With 3D animation, you can do it in the same manner with the animator positioning the meshes of moving things for each frame. But it's sometimes more practical to use cameras to follow a real actor making the movements which are then mapped on to the 3D mesh to make it move.

Pneumonia Pneumonia Also known as Pneumonia is a bacterial, viral, or fungal infection of one or both sides of the lungs that causes the air sacs, or alveoli, of the lungs to fill up with fluid or pus. Symptoms can be mild or severe and may include a cough with phlegm (a slimy substance), fever, chills, and trouble breathing. Many factors affect how serious pneumonia is, such as the type of germ causing the lung infection, your age, and your overall health. Pneumonia tends to be more serious for children under the age of five, adults over the age of 65, people with certain conditions such as heart failure, diabetes, or COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), or people who have weak immune systems due to HIV/AIDS, chemotherapy (a treatment for cancer), or organ or blood and marrow stem cell transplant procedures. To diagnose pneumonia, your doctor will review your medical history, perform a physical exam, and order diagnostic tests. This information can help your doctor determine what type of pneumonia you have. If your doctor suspects you got your infection while in a hospital, you may be diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia. If you have been on a ventilator to help you breathe, you may have ventilator-associated pneumonia. The most common form of pneumonia is community-acquired pneumonia, which is when you get an infection outside of a hospital. Treatment depends on whether bacteria, viruses, or fungi are causing your pneumonia. If bacteria are causing your pneumonia, you usually are treated at home with oral antibiotics. Most people respond quickly to treatment. If your symptoms worsen you should see a doctor right away. If you have severe symptoms or underlying health problems, you may need to be treated in a hospital. It may take several weeks to recover from pneumonia.

Can my Specialist degree be equalized to Bachelor degree? I have graduated from Russian university after 5 years of education and got a Specialist degree (Engineer in Computer Science). According to Wikipedia, Specialist is a four-tier degree and stands right above Master degree in some specialities. But despite graduation requirements and due to the duration, I suggest, it can only be put right above Bachelor degree. So the next step I should take is to continue my education to then get Master degree. Is my suggestion right? Or do I think about it wrong way?

If it helps or is necessary, I'm planning to continue education in Canadian university.
In 27 BC, Lusitania gained the status of Roman province. Later, a northern province of Lusitania was formed, known as Gallaecia, with capital in Bracara Augusta, today's Braga. There are still many ruins of castros (hill forts) all over modern Portugal and remains of Castro culture. Numerous Roman sites are scattered around present-day Portugal, some urban remains are quite large, like Conímbriga and Mirobriga. The former, beyond being one of the largest Roman settlements in Portugal, is also classified as a National Monument. Conímbriga lies 16 km from Coimbra which by its turn was the ancient Aeminium).

The report—prepared by Seattle University criminal justice professors Peter A. Collins and Matthew J. Hickman and law professor Robert C. Boruchowitz, with research support by Alexa D. O’Brien—determined that, on average, Oklahoma capital cases cost 3.2 times more than non-capital cases. Reviewing 15 state studies of death penalty costs conducted between 2000 and 2016, the study found that, across the country, seeking the death penalty imposes an average of approximately $700,000 more in case-level costs than not seeking death. The researchers wrote that "all of these studies have found ... that seeking and imposing the death penalty is more expensive than not seeking it." The Oklahoma study reviewed 184 first-degree murder cases from Oklahoma and Tulsa counties in the years 2004-2010 and analyzed costs incurred at the pre-trial, trial, sentencing, and post-sentencing (appeals and incarceration) stages. Capital prosecutions, it found, cost the counties more than 1½ times the amount of incarceration costs than did non-capital trials because capital defendants spent an average of 324 more days in jail prior to and during death penalty trials. Prosecutors spent triple in pre-trial and trial costs on death penalty proceedings, while defense teams spent nearly 10 times more. Oklahoma capital appeal proceedings cost between five and six times more than non-capital appeals of first-degree murder convictions. The study "conservatively estimated" that an Oklahoma capital case cost $110,000 more on average than a non-capital case. The researchers said their results were "consistent with all previous research on death penalty costs, which have found that in comparing similar cases, seeking and imposing the death penalty is more expensive than not seeking it." They concluded, "It is a simple fact that seeking the death penalty is more expensive. There is not one credible study, to our knowledge, that presents evidence to the contrary." (P. Collins, M. Hickman, and R. Boruchowitz, " An Analysis of the Economic Costs of Capital Punishment in Oklahoma ," April 2017, Appendix 1B to The Report of the Oklahoma Death Penalty Review Commission, April 25, 2017; S. Vincent, " Costly death penalty cases strain state resources, report says ," Tulsa World, Apr. 29, 2017. )New Mexico A February 2017 Fiscal Impact Report prepared by the Legislative Finance Committee of the New Mexico legislature estimated that bringing back the death penalty for three types of homicides in the state would cost as much as $7.2 million over the first three years. The report notes that "Between 1979 and 2007 when the death penalty was an option to prosecutors, there were over 200 death penalty cases filed, but only 15 men sentenced to death and only one execution." The Law Offices of the Public Defender reports that the defense costs for the two New Mexico death penalty cases that remain in the system following the prospective repeal of the state's death penalty statute have been $607.4 thousand for one case and $1.3 million for the other. The Fiscal Impact Report also contains a surve
Yes, and overwhelmingly so. However, you have to be careful about what you mean when you say "Big Bang Theory", for it is *not* a theory about how the universe was *created*, but rather how it has *evolved*.

In the first half of the twentieth century, almost all elevators had no automatic positioning of the floor on which the cab would stop. Some of the older freight elevators were controlled by switches operated by pulling on adjacent ropes. In general, most elevators before WWII were manually controlled by elevator operators using a rheostat connected to the motor. This rheostat (see picture) was enclosed within a cylindrical container about the size and shape of a cake. This was mounted upright or sideways on the cab wall and operated via a projecting handle, which was able to slide around the top half of the cylinder.
- The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that carbohydrates make up 45 to 65 percent of your total daily calories. So, if you get 2,000 calories a day, between 900 and 1,300 calories should be from carbohydrates. That translates to between 225 and 325 grams of carbohydrates a day.
Spy gadgets, top secret documents and bullet holes: Aboard the U.S. Navy ship captured more than 40 years ago by North Korea Spy gadgets, top secret documents and bullet holes: Aboard the U. S. Navy ship captured more than 40 years ago by North Korea By Daily Mail Reporter Published: 17:41 EDT, 17 April 2012 | Updated: 17:41 EDT, 17 April 201214View comments Its captivity is an enduring reminder of tensions between the United States and North Korea throughout the Cold War - the bullet holes riddling its rooms a frightening memory of the lives lost. Now, more than 40 years after its capture by North Korean forces in 1968, photographs from aboard the USS Pueblo give a haunting insight into the lives of the men who struggled to maintain its control. Walls of gauges, switches and typing and printing devices pay tribute to its few short months as a spying ship for the U. S., before it was seized and moored onthe Taedong River in Pyongyang. Captured: USS Pueblo was seized by the North Koreans during the Cold War and is moored in Pyongyang Insight: Photos taken inside this year - 44 years after its capture - show the spying vessel's surveillance hub Remembered: The ship, which contains soldiers' clothes found on board, is now used as a museum The vessel - the only ship of the U. S. Navy currently held captive - is now open to visitors as a museum in North Korea, its unpainted walls and unswept floors capturing a fearful moment in time. Images taken aboard show stark rooms designed to focus on their mission; communication boards stretching into every corner and lookout spots throughout the ship.

Share this article The ship was seized on January 23, 1968; the U. S. Navy claimed it was in international waters, while North Korea said it was sailing within their territory. The Japanese visitor, who took pictures for Rocket News 24, said his guide told him as he toured the vessel: 'Even today, America continues to beg the ship to be returned. 'Spies: The ship was collecting data on Soviet naval patterns when it was chased by North Korean boats Terror: When the ship tried to flee, it came under fire, with the scores of bullet holes still visible Remaining evidence: As they came under attack, the crew failed to destroy all sensitive material The U. S. maintained it was an observation ship, while the North Koreans claimed it was a warship - a claim that could be supported by the scores of bullet holes in the ship, Rocket News reported. According to the American account, Pueblo was on orders to intercept and conduct surveillance of Soviet ships when a North Korean sub chaser crept upon the vessel. When it demanded the ship stand down or expect fire, the American commander attempted to move away but could not out-outmaneuver the sub chaser and growing numbers of torpedo boats. Shock: The men were not prepared for an attack and the ammunition was below deck. One crew member died Lookouts: The ship was travelling from Japan with more than 80 crew members when it was captured History: After the men were snatched from the ship, they were taken to a POW camp where they were tortured Despite expecting an imminent attack, the crew were unable to access the ship's ammunition below deck - and most were untrained in how to use the machine guns, which were wrapped in tarps. With the North Koreans trying to board the ship, one of the sub chasers fired a cannon at the ship, killing a member of the crew. A U. S. soldier, Duane Hodges, was also killed. Other vessels barraged the boat with bullets as the Americans tried to destroy the sensitive material - yet they only managed to ruin 'a small percentage' of documents, according to witnesses.

. An encoder is an electrical mechanical device that converts linear or rotary displacement into digital or pulse signals. The most popular type of encoder is the optical encoder, which consists of a rotating disk, a light source, and a photo detector (light sensor). The disk, which is mounted on the rotating shaft, has patterns of opaque and transparent sectors coded into the disk (see Figure 1). As the disk rotates, these patterns interrupt the light emitted onto the photo detector, generating a digital or pulse signal output. An incremental encoder generates a pulse for each incremental step in it's rotation. Although the incremental encoder does not output absolute position, it can provide high resolution at an acceptable price. For example, an incremental encoder with a single code track, referred to as a tachometer encoder, generates a pulse signal whose frequency indicates the velocity of displacement. However, the output of the single-channel encoder does not indicate direction. To determine direction, a two-channel, or quadrature, encoder uses two detectors and two code tracks. The most common type of incremental encoder uses two output channels (A and B) to sense position. Using two code tracks with sectors positioned 90° out of phase, the two output channels of the quadrature encoder indicate both position and direction of rotation. If A leads B, for example, the disk is rotating in a clockwise direction. If B leads A, then the disk is rotating in a counter-clockwise direction. Therefore, by monitoring both the number of pulses and the relative phase of signals A and B, you can track both the position and direction of rotation. In addition, some quadrature detectors include a third output channel, called a zero or reference signal, which supplies a single pulse per revolution. This single pulse can be used for precise determination of a reference position 
What Is the New Jersey SUI/SDI Tax? If you work in New Jersey, you'll notice a couple extra taxes withheld from your pay. You and the employer pay State Disability Insurance and State Unemployment Insurance taxes. Although additional taxes mean a little less money in your wallet now, they fund programs and benefits that may help if you're ever disabled or out of a job. A close up of a paycheck slipcredit: jianghaistudio/i Stock/Getty Images State Disability Insurance Tax The SDI tax helps fund the New Jersey Temporary Disability Insurance Program. New Jersey's state disability program provides benefits to employees unable to work due to a disability. Unlike workman's compensation, the disability doesn't have to be the result of an injury or illness that occurred on the job. In 2014, the maximum amount of taxable wages for SDI is $31,500. As of 2014, the employer tax rate for SDI is .5 percent. Established employers are assigned pay rates annually based on their experience ratings. All employees pay at a rate of .38 percent on $31,500. State Unemployment Insurance Tax The SUI tax funds the state unemployment program. If you've worked the same job for at least 20 weeks and lose it through no fault of your own, this is the program that could help you out. In 2014, new employers pay 3.4 percent of the employee's taxable wages up to $31,500. Established employers pay rates between 0.60 percent and 6.40 percent on taxable wages. Employees pay 0.3825 percent to the Unemployment Compensation Fund and 0.0425 percent to the Workforce Development Fund, which is a total of 0.4250 percent on wages up to $31,500.

Acting on State Secretary Acheson's recommendation, President Truman ordered General MacArthur to transfer matériel to the Army of the Republic of Korea while giving air cover to the evacuation of U.S. nationals. The President disagreed with advisers who recommended unilateral U.S. bombing of the North Korean forces, and ordered the US Seventh Fleet to protect the Republic of China (Taiwan), whose government asked to fight in Korea. The United States denied ROC's request for combat, lest it provoke a communist Chinese retaliation. Because the United States had sent the Seventh Fleet to "neutralize" the Taiwan Strait, Chinese premier Zhou Enlai criticized both the UN and U.S. initiatives as "armed aggression on Chinese territory."

Sahara Desert - The World's Largest Desert Sahara Desert - The World's Largest Desert The Sahara is the world's largest desert. Only a small part of the Sahara is fertile and it is here that corn, dates and other fruits grow. These parts are fed by underground rivers and oases. The Sahara can be an inspirational experience at night, with the air being crisp, clean and clear and the stars being so close you can almost touch them. The Sahara desert stretches across much of North Africa covering over 9,000,000 square kilometers (roughly the size of the United States ). In fact, the Sahara covers some 30% of the entire African continent. It is the hottest place in the world with summer temperatures that often exceeds 57 degrees Celsius. It has an annual rainfall of 0 - 25 millimeters and is very windy with windstorms sweeping the sand up to heights of 1000 meters and moving the sand dunes constantly. The Sahara consists of one quarter volcanic mountains, one quarter sand, rocks and gravel-covered plains and small areas of vast permanent vegetation. The vegetation includes shrubs, grasses, and trees in the highland and in the oases along the river beds. Some of the plants are well adjusted to the climate since they sprout within three days of rain and sow their seeds within two weeks after that. Animals in the Sahara are mainly Gerbils, Cape Hare, Deer, Weasels, Baboons, Jackals, Sand Foxes, Mongooses, Desert Hedgehogs and over 300 bird species. The following towns and villages are located in the Sahara of Morocco: Tata: Located where the desert meets the mountains, this small desert town has the reputation for being the hottest town in Morocco. Tleta Tagmout: A desert oasis Foum Zguid: Located where the Jebel Bani range meets the desert, this charming desert town boasts one of the largest palm groves in Morocco. Zagora: Located in the magnificent Drâa Valley, this town is a popular starting for camel and 4x4 excursions into the desert. A sign proclaiming that it is 52 days to Timbuktu is one of the most photographed features of the town. Tinfou: This small town is located along the Draa Valley route where the stony ground gives way to the sand-dunes of the desert. Erg Chebbi: This settlement in the dunes of the Sahara offers basic tourist facilities for visitors exploring the enormous sand dunes. Ouarzazate: Catering for the tourist trade, Ouarzazate has a number of hotels and visitors enjoy the typical Moroccan market in the city center. The Kasbah is beautifully preserved and gives in interesting glimpse into the lives of the people who live there. Rissani: Also known as Tafilalt, a cluster of small villages around the town of Rissani, is located along the last stretch of the Ziz valley. The region has a long and fascinating history and was a kingdom separate from Morocco between the 8th and 14th centuries. Merzouga: Located at the start of the oasis zone, inhabitants tap the underground water sources for drinking and irrigation purposes, and the area around the town is well cultivated. Erfoud: This small oasis town is used by many travelers as a base for exploring the beautiful Ziz valley. Popular activities in the Sahara include sunrise and sunset camel rides over the dunes, sleeping out under the desert skies, ATV/4X4 trips, visiting traditional Berber villages, dune-boarding.

As computational work becomes more and more integral to many aspects of scientific research, computational reproducibility has become an issue of increasing importance to computer systems researchers and domain scientists alike. Though computational reproducibility seems more straight forward than replicating physical experiments, the complex and rapidly changing nature of computer environments makes being able to reproduce and extend such work a serious challenge. In this paper, I explore common reasons that code developed for one research project cannot be successfully executed or extended by subsequent researchers. I review current approaches to these issues, including virtual machines and workflow systems, and their limitations. I then examine how the popular emerging technology Docker combines several areas from systems research - such as operating system virtualization, cross-platform portability, modular re-usable elements, versioning, and a 'DevOps' philosophy, to address these challenges. I illustrate this with several examples of Docker use with a focus on the R statistical environment.

Dilution (equation) Dilution (equation) Dilution is a reduction in the pH of a chemical (gas, vapor, solution). It is the process of decreasing the concentration of a solute in solution, usually simply by mixing with more solvent. To dilute a solution means to add more solvent without the addition of more solute.
Hot air and steam (and cold air) all have different densities. When light passes through one density to another then it changes direction, like going through glass, water, or air. All of those are "clear" but you can notice the changes in image through them. The same happens to shadows. Glass makes a certain shadow, flowing water will have a shadow, and heat waves or steam will create shadows.
Bridge of Spies (film) Bridge of Spies is a 2015 historical drama legal thriller film directed and co-produced by Steven Spielberg, written by Matt Charman, Ethan and Joel Coen and stars Tom Hanks, Mark Rylance, Amy Ryan, and Alan Alda. Set during the Cold War, the film tells the story of lawyer James B. Donovan, who is entrusted with negotiating the release of Francis Gary Powers—a U.S. Air Force pilot whose U-2 spy plane was shot down over the Soviet Union in 1960—in exchange for Rudolf Abel, a convicted Soviet KGB spy held under the custody of the United States, whom he represented at trial. The name of the film refers to the Glienicke Bridge, which connects Potsdam with Berlin, where the prisoner exchange took place. The film was an international co-production of the United States and Germany.

Search engine click logs provide an invaluable source of relevance information, but this information is biased. A key source of bias is presentation order: the probability of click is influenced by a document's position in the results page. This paper focuses on explaining that bias, modelling how probability of click depends on position. We propose four simple hypotheses about how position bias might arise. We carry out a large data-gathering effort, where we perturb the ranking of a major search engine, to see how clicks are affected. We then explore which of the four hypotheses best explains the real-world position effects, and compare these to a simple logistic regression model. The data are not well explained by simple position models, where some users click indiscriminately on rank 1 or there is a simple decay of attention over ranks. A â cascade' model, where users view results from top to bottom and leave as soon as they see a worthwhile document, is our best explanation for position bias in early ranks

Not really nerves, but [trigger hairs](_URL_0_). If you look at the stiff hairs in that picture, those are the trigger hairs. The traps only close if one hair is touched twice within about 30 seconds, or if multiple hairs are touched within 30 seconds (this process prohibits the trap from closing half-cocked with nothing to show for it). The hairs transfer mechanical energy into electrical energy that signals pores to open in cells on the outside of the trap, allowing water to rush from cells on the inside of the trap to cells on the outside of the trap, causing the traps to shut.

The 7 Best Big Sedans for the Least Dough By michael frank Oct 10, 2011Times are tough—and so are our roads. But fear not. The oversize sedan may seem like a historical footnote, but there are plenty of contemporary cruisers that can glide across pavement and won't cost you a fortune. We picked apart seven of these posh rides to discover which is the best sedan for your buck. View Gallery7 Photos1 of 7Toyota Avalon$33,195; 121.3 cubic feet; $273.66 per cubic foot If you've driven an Avalon, you know what it is—a Lexus minus the Lexus name. While the car is decidedly expensive, it drives expensive. And in this price class, the Avalon is pretty tough to touch, with its roominess, supremely quiet interior, and superb fit and finish. It's a big car with the smoothest engine of any on our list, save the Ford Taurus, and a ride that errs on the soft side, but never to the detriment of safety. You probably won't find yourself rallying it around curves like we did—you know, just to make sure that it could (check)—but if you have to hustle it past a surging flow of cars in the merge lane, the 268-hp V6 steams up nicely. Inside, where it counts, the Avalon is due for a refresh (probably coming for spring), but nothing is radically amiss. The seats are huge and supportive, and only the Chrysler 300 can best the Avalon's front shoulder room (it's nearly a tie, at 59.4 inches for the Toyota and 59.5 for the Chrysler). The Avalon has the best rear shoulder room of the lot and the best rear legroom, as well. The big Toyota gets 20 mpg in the city; of the other V6s, only the Hyundai Azera can match that mileage.2 of 7Buick La Crosse$29,960; 112.6 cubic feet; $266.07 per cubic foot The La Crosse is expensive for its interior size, which is the smallest of any car on this list. It is a poised car and the only hybrid in this mix (the hybrid is the base model for the 2012 Lacrosse), which gives it a best-in-class fuel economy of 25 city/36 highway, and at a better horsepower rating than the VW Passat (182 hp versus 170 hp). Volkswagen might counter that its diesel Passat gets better fuel economy than the hybrid La Crosse, but the diesel VW's price-to-cubic foot ratio climbs to $220.48—still slightly below the Buick's, but not by as much. (More on the Passat coming up.) Mileage aside, this Buick is far more stable than your grandpappy's car with the Landau roof. It's not exactly a Porsche 911, but that's not what you'd want from a long-mileage cruiser anyway. The problem with the La Crosse is that, while it's large enough to be compared with the big sedans, it simply can't match up. The Buick has the least amount of front headroom and the worst scores for rear hip, shoulder, and headroom. It also has the smallest trunk. Don't get us wrong—the Buick is a nice car that comes with an extra year and 50,000 miles to its warranty (everything else on this list is at 3 years/36,000 miles). But it's designed to spar with Toyota Camrys, Ford Fusions, and Honda Accords.3 of 7Chrysler 300$27,170; 122.3 cubic feet; $222.15 per cubic foot This Chrysler is huge. It's only a hair away from being the biggest car here. But frankly, it's much more expensive than it should be. The finish quality is decidedly lower than average for this class, with lots of sloppy details such as loose padding in the trunk, visible hardware and wiring harnesses—lots of stuff to remind you of the bad old days of Detroit and why you went the import route. The 300 is a solid driving machine that obliterates highway miles as easily as any car in the lot, but you don't get the comfort of the Avalon, the German attitude of the Passat, or the clean trim and modern design of the Taurus. Plus, the standard 300 brings a five-speed transmission to a battle of six-speeds. That wouldn't be a big deal if you opted for the V8 that Chrysler offers, which overcomes everything with horsepower. But we're comparing the base versions, and this five-speed seems to always overshift on windy roads and never downshift when you need it to. Manually overriding is an option, but it is plagued by delays. The

This enables the blood vessels to relax, which ultimately results in better blood flow. The effects of Amlodipine also make it much easier for the heart to pump blood throughout the body, which lowers the pet’s blood pressure.

I often end up crying during my research. Due to the area I study I focus specifically on the 'lighter' topics within it, and even those can be very distressing. However, I think I'd be extremely worried if it didn't phase me. When you're seeing the personal experience of someone who you have a 'connection' with through their work it's very easy to understand their lives, whereas "40 million" is a number, a horrible number, but less distressing in a lot of ways.

With a total height of 829.8 m (2,722 ft) and a roof height (excluding antenna) of 828 m (2,717 ft), the Burj Khalifa has been the tallest structure in the world since its topping out in late 2008. [4] [9] It is also called "Burj Dubai" for being the tallest building in the United Arab Emirates. It was later named "Burj Khalifa" on the 3rd anniversary in 2011. Construction of the Burj Khalifa began in 2004, with the exterior completed five years later in 2009. The primary structure is reinforced concrete. The building was opened in 2010 as part of a new development called Downtown Dubai. It is designed to be the centrepiece of large-scale, mixed-use development. The decision to construct the building is reportedly based on the government's decision to diversify from an oil-based economy, and for Dubai to gain international recognition. The building was originally named Burj Dubai but was renamed in honour of the ruler of Abu Dhabi and president of the United Arab Emirates, Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan; [3] Abu Dhabi and the UAE government lent Dubai money to pay its debts. The building broke numerous height records, including its designation as the tallest building in the world. Burj Khalifa was designed by Adrian Smith, then of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM), whose firm designed the Willis Tower and One World Trade Center. Hyder Consulting was chosen to be the supervising engineer with NORR Group Consultants International Limited chosen to supervise the architecture of the project. The design is derived from the Islamic architecture of the region, such as in the Great Mosque of Samarra. The Y-shaped tripartite floor geometry is designed to optimize residential and hotel space. A buttressed central core and wings are used to support the height of the building. Although this design was derived from Tower Palace III, the Burj Khalifa’s central core houses all vertical transportation with the exception of egress stairs within each of the wings. [10] The structure also features a cladding system which is designed to withstand Dubai's hot summer temperatures. It contains a total of 57 elevators and 8 escalators. Critical reception to Burj Khalifa has been generally positive, and the building h

Top 8 List Fiverr Alternatives for 2012 - 2017 Top 8 Fiverr Aternatives with great traffic for 2017Fiverr originally started out as a new and very unique concept. There were only the big freelancing websites like Elance and Freelancer etc back then. So Fiverr brought a very refreshing change. Whether you are a proper freelancer or just a regular office-going guy, Fiverr gives you a chance to earn some quick bucks so you can cover up your extravagances. Fiverr is also a great place to get your freelancing career started. But the trouble is, Fiverr only allows you to earn $5 minus their commission per gig. For some people, this might not be enough. Luckily for them, many alternative websites to fiverr have emerged over the years. Fiverr was such a success that many others adopted the idea and came up with their own version of Fiverr. Most of these aren't very good, but some might just be better than Fiverr! So here, we will discuss about the top 10 alternatives to fiverr you must try. Why not Fiverr? There're a few legit reasons why you would not want to stay with Fiverr. It might seem very attractive, but it does has short-comings. Firstly, it doesn't pay you very well. Now I know people make hundreds of dollars off it every month, but considering the effort, is it really worth it? %5 is sort of a bottleneck which you might want to eventually break out of. Secondly, you don't even earn a full $5. Fiverr commission is 20%, which is huge by any standards! So essentially, you only get $4, and the remaining one dollar goes to Fiverr. Imagine you complete 200 gigs in a month. You will only get $800, where you could be getting a full grand. That's just $200 down the drain!Fiverr is no longer what it once was. It started off as a fun place where people could make use of their creativity. But over the years, it has become quite competitive. Much more complicated jobs are being done now for a much smaller price. Let me give you an example. I spotted two different gigs on fiverr. One promised to "Suggest a professional name and motto for a website," while another said, "I will create an attractive dynamic website using HTML, CSS, PHP, and Java Script for $5. "Do you see the injustice? The guy who suggests professional names probably is a natural at this. He might hardly take 10 minutes to come up with a good name and slogan. But the web-designer has to work for hours, just for a petty $4. Both these guys will earn the same. The point is, Fiverr might just not be worth it if it takes more than 30 minutes t complete a gig. In that case, you need to look on to alternatives, some of which we have right here for you. Top 8 Fiverr Alternatives1. Fiver Up This is one of my favorite websites. Website similar to Fiverr. The interface works very similar. And the services are the same with many more options like: Buy and sell gigs from $4 to $100Shipping Instant Delivery Video Gigs Push your gig to front page once per day FREE. Free account verification for more sales. Express D elivery Gig Extras No withdrawal limit They tweet to 100K followers They post your gigs on bog.fiverup.com Makes this site one of the best Fiverr Aternatives in the world. Costumer service response in less than 12 hours. Try these guys out and you will not be disappointed. Fiver Up.com2. Gig Bucks Gig Bucks is is a very popular alternative to Fiverr. It hosts gigs for all the categories found on fiverr. It gives freelancers the opportunity to charge an appropriate amount of money for their services. A gig can be anywhere in the range of $5 to $50, definitely a big step up from the $4 on fiverr. Just like Fiverr, joining is absolutely free. And you can post as many gigs as you like. A must try for existing fiverr users or other people.3. Zeerk Zeerk is another big fish up for grabs. Working at Zeerk can be much more worth your while. You can charge as much as $100 per gig! Now, services can charged appropriately and no one needs feel left out! For small jobs such as $2 or $5 jobs, there is no commission! And I thought Fiverr was cool!4. SEOClerks Seo Clerks contains gi

Ojos del Salado The elevation of Ojos del Salado has been the subject of debate. The mountain is hidden behind other peaks and thus its height was not appreciated in early research until 1937, when the mountain was climbed by Polish climbers. A 2006 article in Andes Magazine offered that Ojos del Salado may be higher than Aconcagua, although the argument was premised on older, less accurate altitude surveys. The results of these older surveys assigned Ojos del Salado an elevation of , which would have made it nearly higher than Aconcagua. As early as 1955, an estimate was made that the elevation
There are [a couple of antibiotics that do reduce the effectiveness of the contraceptive pill](_URL_0_). The two antibiotics that do so are known as enzyme inducing, meaning they speed up the body's processing of the hormones in the contraceptive pill. However these two antibiotics are not too common. Antibiotics in general affecting contraception is a myth, possibly linked to sexist ideas that women on antibiotics shouldn't have sex (wise advice if it's for treatment of am STI, otherwise not).
It may not be the only reason, but physical activity is generally cheaper for smaller animals than for larger ones - loosely, the energy required to move your body depends on its mass, which scales with the cube of size, whereas the muscle cross-section doing the moving scales with the square. This is the same reason why e.g. fleas can jump distances that would be utterly ludicrous if scaled up to human dimensions. [edited for clarity]

onal europe politics government local government house believes northern ireland There is no evidence that the Catholic population today suffers a bias in the current political system, except for that which they make for themselves. As of 2010 the Catholic representation in the House of Commons is 5 Sinn Fein and 3 SDLP against 8 Democratic Unionists,* it is only the fact that the Sinn Fein members do not take up their seats that make things uneven. In the NI Assembly things are slightly more skewed. As of 2011 there are 55 Unionists and 43 Republicans.**

Attacks against Catholics are not based on religious lines. Unionist attacks are only focused on those Catholics that are Republicans. In general Catholics are perfectly safe in Northern Ireland.

Additionally in united Ireland, the Protestants would become the marginalized minority. Abortion is illegal in the Republic of Ireland***, for example, which will inhibit the freedom of non- Catholics. Such laws are likely to stay because of the overwhelming Catholic majority.

Cells adhere to things because they have surface molecules called [selectins](_URL_2_) and [integrins](_URL_0_) (and a lot of other proteins that aren't in those classes) that bind to ECM structures. They don't "like" parts of the ECM, they just have proteins that bind to parts of it. See: [CAMs](_URL_1_).  Just to provide an example. Melanocytes always have these proteinss expressed, and so they adhere. When you grow melanoma tumor lines they adhere to the flasks that we use as well. T cells are non adherent normally, but when activated and going to the site of an infection they express selectins which allow them to roll along blood vessels slowly. In flasks T cells float (We call them suspension cells as opposed to adherent cells).

Whether raw or cooked, food can be chock-full of dangerous bacteria long before you can smell it. Perishable food (like chicken and other meats) should be tossed if left out at room temperature more than two hours (much less if in a warm room).

The comments here about the fragility of oxygen-oxygen bonds are correct. There's another thing to think about, too: H2O is, of course, a very small molecule. Adding another whole oxygen atom to it is really a very large change (consider, right off the top, that you've increased its molecular weight by nearly 90%). There's no way to add or subtract an atom to any molecule that size without profoundly changing its properties.

How to Prime an Electric Fuel Pump How to Prime an Electric Fuel Pump What You'll Need Manufacturer's directions Gloves An electric fuel pump is an essential component which can be found in your car. The fuel pump is used to make sure the natural gas or propane travels through to the engine. The fuel must travel through a hose, also called the fuel line, and it is the job of the fuel pump to make sure the gas reaches the proper location. The fuel pump is used in any car where gravity cannot be used to pump the fuel into the system. There are two types of engines. The first is known as a carborated engine and the other is known as a fuel injected engine. The fuel injected engine in most cases will use an electric fuel pump. Below are instructions on how to prime the electric fuel pump. Step 1 - Find the Fuel Pump Make sure the car is off and make sure it has been sitting for at least a couple hours. You will be working around the fuel injection components of your car and you can easily get burnt if the car is still warm. Put on protective gloves before you work inside and around the car. Pop the top of your hood and look for the fuel tank. If you are not sure where the fuel tank is, then pull out your manufacturer's directions. Once you have located the fuel tank, locate the electric fuel pump. The pump is usually located inside the tank. Step 2 - Flip the Switch There should be a prime switch located on the fuel pump line. Flick the switch to prime the fuel pump. You can prime the fuel pump a couple of times but do not leave it in the "on" position. Step 3 - Close the Hood and Clean Up Close the hood of the car and clean up your work area. Clean your hands completely with a cleaning agent that will remove any remnants of the fuel on your hands. Step 4 - Test the Car Test out the car. Re-prime the electric fuel pump if necessary. A Few Notes: This is generally something you will want to do when you want to bleed your line. For normal automobile operation, you will not need to prime your electric fuel pump. A prime switch is also used for safety reasons. You can use the prime switch when your engine may seem to start to die or when the filters in the car become clogged. Some models of electric fuel pumps do not need to be primed by hand as they have a self priming feature built in. Be sure to check the information located in the manufacturer's book of information to find out what type of priming system your car has. If you are unsure, consult the help of a certified automotive mechanic to prime your electric fuel pump. Comments

According to experts, no. It's a bit of an urban myth. However, staring at them for long periods of time can cause discomfort, albeit not permanently.
You actually *do* feel it. Because of your angular momentum, there is a slight centrifugal force acting in you, pulling you away from the center of mass of the planet. This effect, however, is small and is matched by the centrifugal forces experienced by everything around you — which all have the same or nearly the same angular momentum. You're not *aware* of this force vector because there is never an appreciable and swift change in the acceleration it provides — there is no *jerk* of it. Since gravity provides acceleration towards the centre of mass of the planet, our brains are used to constant acceleration and think of that as "steady" and "normal". We perceive not the acceleration itself but the *change* of acceleration — termed the *jerk*. So, in short, you're not aware of it because they're not jerks about it.

He has a brother named Ajitabh. He completed his education from Uttar Pradesh and moved to Bombay to find work as a film star, in vain though, as film-makers preferred someone with a fairer skin, and he was not quite fair enough. But they did use one of his other assets, his deep baritone voice, which was used for narration and background commentary. He was successful in being cast in Saat Hindustani. He got his break in Bollywood after a letter of introduction from the then Prime Minister Mrs. Indira Gandhi, as he was a friend of her son, Rajiv Gandhi. This is how Amitabh made an entry in Bollywood, starting with Zanjeer, co-starred with his future wife Jaya Bhaduri, and since then there has been no looking back. He married Jaya Bhaduri, an accomplished actress in her own right, and they had two children, Shweta and Abhishek. Shweta is married, lives a non-filmy life and has two children. Being friends with Rajiv Gandhi, got him to decide to run for seat in the Congress from his hometown but had to leave midterm because of controversies, particularly after Rajiv and he were implicated in the now infamous "Bofors" case along with the U. K. based Hinduja Brothers. After a four year break, he was back in the unsuccessful Mrityudaata (1997), a comeback which the actor wanted to forget. Critics written him off but his career was saved with Bade Miyan Chote Miyan (1998). But four flops in 1999 and incurring debt of over 90 Crores rupees of his sinking company ABCL saw him at an all-time low. To make matters worse, after the defeat of the Congress party, Amitabh lost considerable political support, the opposition made him a target, and his credit rating deteriorated to such an extent that a leading nationalized bank, Canara Bank, sued him for outstanding loans. He did bounce back, presenting the Indian version of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire called Kaun Banega Crorepati? (2000). After a series of hits with Mohabbatein (2000), Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001) and Baghban (2003) and Khakee (2004), this elderly Bachchan is showing no signs of slowing down and proving the critics wrong once again. His son, Abhishek, is also an actor by his own rights. Amitabh and Jaya were interested in getting Abhishek married to Karishma, the daughter of Babita and Randhir Kapoor, they went through a formal engagement, but later broke it off. The former Miss World and Bollywood actress, Aishwarya Rai, and Abhishek, were formally engaged on Sunday January 14, 2007, at the Bachchan residence in Juhu, Bombay, with the marriage taking place at the Bachchan residence on April 20, 2007. On November 16, 2011, he became a Dada (Paternal Grandfather) when Aishwarya gave birth to a daughter in Mumbai Hospital. He is already a Nana (maternal grandfather) to Navya Naveli and Agastye - Shweta's children. He continues to be one of the busiest actors and singers in Bollywood as well as on TV, as can be seen from the commercials that he appears on, especially on Sahara One. Looks like there are no limits for this super-star and once the "Angry Young Man" of Bollywood.- IMDb Mini Biography By: r Aj Oo The trademark deep baritone voice, the tall, brooding persona, and intense eyes, made Amitabh Bachchan the ideal "Angry Young Man" in the 1975-84.

. Jamaican Culture Jamaican culture describes the Jamaican religion, Jamaican lifestyle and Jamaican society on a whole. Jamaican culture is what defines a people. This portal links to all websites that deal with Jamaican culture. Christmas Past Mento Music Classical Musicians Mystic Online Garvey Liberty Hall Rootz Reggae Gathering of the Healers House of Bobo Speak Jamaican Shakti Yoga Sun RASon Jamaica Treasures Jamaican Jokes Jamaicans Culture Jamaican Culture And Jamaican Traditions Jamaican culture can be aptly described as the Jamaican human activity within different aspects of everyday life that relate to Jamaican traditions. Jamaican culture can be divided into several sectors or sects, usually called Jamaican aspects of culture. Origin: Jamaican culture is defined as the origin of its entire population. The Jamaican culture is mixed as most of the society is ethnically diverse. There are several nations and peoples, the majority are African, then Indian and Chinese, then the minority being European. There is a North American contingent but they did not contribute to the origin and main stream Jamaican society. Traditions: Jamaican traditions assist in defining the culture of the society. Jamaican traditions are ritualistic acts that are carried out over a specific period of time or at a specific event. This is very prevalent in Jamaican society and is fundamental in defining Jamaican culture. The most popular Jamaican traditions are for most national holidays, such as Christmas cake, Sorrel, pudding at Christmas time, Fried fish, lent at Easter time and other national holidays. Rituals such as the famed Nine Night after the death of a loved one are a popular Jamaican tradition that characterizes the Jamaican culture. Cuisine: Jamaican cuisine and cooking is an important aspect of cultural embodiment. The foods and the recipes make a culture richer. The Jamaican culture has been enriched by superb Jamaican foods such as Jerk Chicken Recipes, Jerk Pork and the infamous Red Stripe Beer. It is foods such as these that help to define Jamaican culture. Religion: Another key indicator and unifying aspect Jamaican culture. Jamaican has developed a unique type of religion. The primary type called Pocomania which was a blend between European Christianity and African religious practices, the secondary is Rastafarianism. This religion is practically by a small amount of people in the country, hence is not really a unifying aspect but gives Jamaican culture through religion its uniqueness and hence requires mention. Music: Reggae and its derivatives such as dance hall, rock steady are key for the development of Jamaican culture. This music has its origins in Jamaica and cannot be claimed by any other nation. The captivating type of music has led to a growing following. The music has an upbeat aspect to it’s with constant rhythmic beats. Art and Clothing: Jamaican Art and Clothing are both very important in defining Jamaican culture. Jamaican art has steeped in the depicting Jamaican everyday life. This has manifested it self in sculptures, paintings, collage and craft works. This is a direct shift from the more abstract type of European art and even the African more morbid types of art that focus a lot on history. Jamaican art culture at most does not focus on history. Jamaican clothing does reflect culture. Though Jamaican clothing and fashion is not as popular as European and African clothing it is defined by the use of primary colors and the popular use of cotton because of the tropical climate. Folk Lure: This is yet to be aptly recognized as a part of culture. Folk lure can often be cited as a part of Jamaican tradition however folk lure is stories and ballads passed down through the generations. However this is not really the case but folk lure and happenings are carried through in dance and drama which fall under ‘other arts’ another corner stone of culture. Other Arts – Jamaican dance, drama and speech in culture. Primarily Jamaican culture is depicted in dance by folk music, dancing kumina, the quadrille and other 
One controversial idea in my field: whether prions (infectious proteins) are taken up by plants, where they may be harbored and concentrated before later being consumed by the mammalian host, transmitting the agent. The plants aren't specifically *affected* though they could still be considered *infected* with the prion.

. In the United States and the rest of the northern hemisphere, the first day of the spring season is the day of the year when the Sun crosses the celestial equator moving northward (on March 20 th or 21 st ). This day is known as the Vernal Equinox . A common misconception is that the earth is further from the sun in winter than in summer. Actually, the Earth is closest to the sun in December which is winter in the Northern hemisphere. As the Earth travels around the Sun in its orbit, the north-south position of the Sun changes over the course of the year because of the changing orientation of the Earth's tilted rotation axes. The dates of maximum tilt of the Earth's equator correspond to the Summer Solstice and Winter Solstice, and the dates of zero tilt to the Vernal Equinox and Autumnal Equinox . The reason for these changes has to do with the Earth's yearly trip around the sun. For part of the year the Earth's North Pole points away from the sun and part of the time toward it. This is what causes our seasons. When the North Pole points toward the sun, the sun's rays hit the northern half of the world more directly. That means it is warmer and we have summer. The declination of the Sun on the vernal equinox is 0° 00'. On the day of the vernal equinox, day and night are nearly the same amounts of time. In the United States, there are about 12 hours of daylight on this day. Tornado Season March is the traditional start of tornado season in the United States. Although tornadoes can occur at any time throughout the year, the peak activity period is March through early July, according to the National Weather Service (NWS). An average of 1,200 tornadoes touch down in the United States each year, and most of them form during this tornado season. Because these storms kill about 70 Americans annually and injure some 1,500 others, disaster experts urge families to be prepared — particularly those who live in Tornado Alley. Tornado Alley is roughly defined as the area of the Central Plains from Texas to Nebraska. This is where most tornadoes form each season. Much of the damage that tornadoes inflict each year occurs in this region of the country. Texas has the highest number of tornadoes, with an average of 124 each year. Tornado map courtesy U. S. Geological Survey Links Ready - Ready.gov is a national public service advertising (PSA) campaign designed to educate and empower Americans to prepare for and respond to emergencies including natural and man-made disasters. The goal of the campaign is to get the public involved and ultimately to increase the level of basic preparedness across the nation.

The current is the same everywhere in a series circuit. The purpose of the resistor in that circuit is to limit the current which flows through the LED. For this purpose, it doesn't matter if the resistor comes before or after the LED, since the current drawn from the battery depends on the equivalent impedance of the entire branch. This is independent of whether the resistor comes before or after the LED.

How long can you keep uncooked bacon in the fridge? Food & Drink Cooking & Recipes How long can you keep uncooked bacon in the fridge? I bought uncooked turkey bacon that has a sell by date of April 1rst. Once I open the package can I put it in a zip lock and leave it in the fridge until April?1 following 10 answers Answers Relevance Rating Newest Oldest Best Answer: I would trim a couple weeks off of that. Or put it in the freezer. It'd probably still be good on April o1, but that IS A FOOLS day. Get as much air out of the packaging, regardless of what you decide. Vacuum sealers are great for making food last a little longer. No need to be a fool on April 1st.thinkaboutmoney · 7 years ago0 2 Comment Store Bacon Source (s):https://shrinkurl.im/a82a Adevereux · 1 year ago0 0 Comment Most people tend to still eat the meat a few days past the sell-by-date as the expiration date is usually later. I am not one of those people. You can always freeze it by April 1st and eat it later. Bacon is a cured meat and if kept at proper temps will last much longer than 4 days after opened. It's normally very easy to tell when bacon is bad by the smell. Most people don't keep their fridge at cold enough temps and if you find your bacon going bad in 3 days you need recheck your temps. To the person below me: bacon or any other meat will keep way longer when frozen. You can freeze bacon and eat it a year later. It will lose some flavor and taste different if not vacuum sealed but will not make you sick.sir_blunted · 7 years ago1 4 Comment Once you open the package you must use the bacon within a couple of weeks or else it will spoil. I M MORTAL · 7 years ago0 1 Comment It will be good if is frozen till april 1st. Don not unfreze the freze again cuz ill not be good to eat after. Unfrozen you can keep it no more than 24 hours at most, depending on temperature, coolder si better.ady_the.killer · 7 years ago0 2 Commentbacon is resistant but not immune to bacteria.

Film is much higher quality than any of the digital video formats in common use. You can't really put a number on film's exact resolution, but it's ~9-10 megapixels; when you scan a 35mm negative into a computer, you keep discovering additional details until you reach 9 to 10 megapixels, so that's its rough resolution, varying a little depending on the exact brand and quality. DVD is only 0.34 (USA/Japan) or 0.41 (Australia/Europe) megapixels. HDTV is only 0.9, and Blu-ray is only 2.1. 4K is 8. Or in other words: if we take a film reel and use a big scanner to create a digital video from it, scanning at Blu-ray resolution only captures around 1/5th of the detail in the film. That's how they make DVDs/Blurays, they use a big scanner. 8K is the first digital video format we've created that's higher-quality than professional-quality 35mm film. It's still not better than 70mm film (the kind used for 2001: A Space Odyssey, Spartacus, Lawrence of Arabia, etc and Soviet films of the 70s and 80s).

Is Creatine Safe? How The King Of Performance Supps Affects Your Organs Nutrition Supplementation Is Creatine Safe? How The King Of Performance Supps Affects Your Organs Kurtis Frank & Sol Orwell August 29, 2017 • 6 min read Creatine is a vitamin for some, a bogeyman for others. Do you have any reason to fear the king of performance supplements? "Part of creatine's appeal is due to its effectiveness. "Creatine is, without a doubt, one of the most popular sports supplements of our time. Given how directly people associate it with improved performance and body composition you could even place it ahead of whey protein powder, which many athletes now seem to treat like a food—or, in some cases, a food group. Part of creatine's appeal is, of course, due to its effectiveness. Most of the people who take it simply see greater strength, power, and muscle growth as a result, and the research backs this up. Creatine also happens to be one of the most studied supplements, both in a sports setting and in how it interacts with various medical conditions. In short, if you're not taking creatine because you're afraid of a certain side effect, that side effect has probably been looked at in a laboratory setting. Want the straight truth about what creatine will or won't do to your heart, liver, or kidneys? Here's what the existing research has to say. General Side Effects and Concerns First off: Yes, creatine can cause water retention. This is probably no surprise. Regardless, unless you have a specific concern—like hypertension that requires treatment with diuretics—it's not a medical issue. For people concerned about looking bloated, the water retention happens in your muscles, so it actually makes you look a bit larger. This explains why some bodybuilders cut out creatine near the end of their contest prep. The rest of us needn't worry. Regarding other potential side effects: Stomach distress. This can happen when you take too much creatine at once, perhaps during a loading phase, without much else in your stomach. The remedy is usually simple: either increase your water and food intake when you take creatine or just take smaller doses of creatine throughout the day. Intestinal distress or diarrhea. This also can happen when you simply take too much creatine in a single dose. Since it cannot be absorbed in high quantities, this can cause osmotic diarrhea, a condition where water gets drawn into the bowels. The solution, again, is to take smaller doses. All of the common side effects associated with creatine stem from its absorption profile in the intestines. At low doses, around 1-3 grams, creatine is absorbed well. As the dose gets higher, the absorption decreases, which is why you can't overdose on creatine—at least, not in a way that would present a medical concern. There are some claims that creatine can contribute to cardiovascular issues such as arrhythmia, but they seem to be based on anecdotes and the placebo effect. What About The Liver? A common knock against creatine is that it's bad for the liver, but this doesn't withstand scrutiny. A number of human studies have looked specifically at creatine usage and liver parameters and found no association between the supplement and liver problems. 1,2If you really want to go cherry-picking, a single study found liver problems in a particular mouse strain after 300 days of supplementation. 3 Even with that in mind, human studies done on people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease, over a span of 9-16 months failed to find any problems with liver enzymes. 4-6What About The Kidneys? The idea that creatine could cause kidney damage comes from the following logic: One of the tests for a malfunctioning kidney is for creatinine. If the creatinine levels in your blood are high, your kidneys could be malfunctioning. Creatinine is a waste product of creatine, and loading creatine will increase your creatinine levels. Elevated creatinine levels in and of themselves aren't a problem. They can be indicative of kidney problems, but they can also occur inde

The tongue can detects five different tastes: salty, sweet, sour, bitter and umami (savoury flavours). Toothpaste becomes foamy when brushing. the foam is made by a chemical called sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS). SLS stops your sweet taste buds stop working so well. SLS also destroys fats that block your bitter taste buds. SLS hides the sweetness of orange juice and makes it taste bitterer.

Officially it's illegal to teach children about homosexualism. As the result, some gay teens were accused for "gay propaganda" just because they came out.  Putin is sure that homosexualism is choice, that it's something that comes from "perverted rotten west". He thinks that if isolate kids from it, there will be less gay people (of course, he assumes gay people are bad). He ignores the fact that there were as many gay people in USSR as now in Russia.

Moby-Dick chase, Ahab leaves Starbuck in charge of the "Pequod". Moby Dick smashes the three boats that seek him into splinters and tangles their lines. Ahab is rescued, but his ivory leg and Fedallah are lost. Starbuck begs Ahab to desist, but Ahab vows to slay the white whale, even if he would have to dive through the globe itself to get his revenge. On the third day of the chase, Ahab sights Moby Dick at noon, and sharks appear, as well. Ahab lowers his boat for a final time, leaving Starbuck again on board. Moby Dick breaches and destroys two

Seattle is widely considered one of the most liberal cities in the United States, even surpassing its neighbor, Portland, Oregon. Support for issues such as same-sex marriage and reproductive rights are largely taken for granted in local politics. In the 2012 U.S. general election, an overwhelming majority of Seattleites voted to approve Referendum 74 and legalize gay marriage in Washington state. In the same election, an overwhelming majority of Seattleites also voted to approve the legalization of the recreational use of cannabis in the state. Like much of the Pacific Northwest (which has the lowest rate of church attendance in the United States and consistently reports the highest percentage of atheism), church attendance, religious belief, and political influence of religious leaders are much lower than in other parts of America.
In January, Japan invaded Burma, the Dutch East Indies, New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and captured Manila, Kuala Lumpur and Rabaul. After being driven out of Malaya, Allied forces in Singapore attempted to resist the Japanese during the Battle of Singapore but surrendered to the Japanese on 15 February 1942; about 130,000 Indian, British, Australian and Dutch personnel became prisoners of war. The pace of conquest was rapid: Bali and Timor also fell in February. The rapid collapse of Allied resistance had left the "ABDA area" split in two. Wavell resigned from ABDACOM on 25 February, handing control of the ABDA Area to local commanders and returning to the post of Commander-in-Chief, India.

Conquest of Wales by Edward I The Conquest of Wales by Edward I , sometimes referred to as the Edwardian Conquest of Wales , Examples of historians using the term include Professor J.E. Lloyd , regarded as the founder of the modern academic study of Welsh history , in his History of Wales from the Earliest Times to the Edwardian Conquest , first published in 1911 , and Professor R.R. Davies , the leading modern scholar of the period , in his works including The Age of Conquest : Wales , 1063 -- 1415 , published 2000 . took place between 1277 and 1283 . It resulted in the defeat and annexation of the Principality of Wales , and the other last remaining independent Welsh principalities , by Edward I , King of England .   By the 13th century Wales was divided between native Welsh principalities and the territories of the Anglo-Norman Marcher lords . The leading principality was Gwynedd whose princes had gained control of the greater part of the country , making the other remaining Welsh princes their vassals , and had taken the title Prince of Wales . Although English monarchs had made several attempts to seize control of the native Welsh territories , it was not until Edward 's war of conquest against Llywelyn ap Gruffudd ( `` Llywelyn the Last '' ) of 1277 to 1283 that this was achieved on a lasting basis .   In two campaigns , in 1277 and 1282/1283 respectively , Edward first significantly reduced the territory of the Principality of Wales and then completely overran it , as well as the other remaining Welsh principalities . Most of the conquered territory was retained as a royal fief , and these lands subsequently became , by custom , the territorial endowment of the heir to the English throne with the title Prince of Wales . The remainder would be granted to Edward 's supporters as new Marcher lordships . Although the territories would not be effectively incorporated into the Kingdom of England until the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 -- 1542 , Edward 's conquest marked the end of Welsh independence .

(August 2013) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message)Oberlin was founded in 1833 by two Presbyterian ministers, John Jay Shipherd and Philo P. Stewart. The pair had become friends while spending the summer of 1832 together in nearby Elyria and discovered a shared dissatisfaction with what they saw as the lack of strong Christian morals among the settlers of the American West. Their proposed solution was to create a religious community that would more closely adhere to Biblical commandments, along with a school for training Christian missionaries who would eventually spread throughout the American frontier. The two decided to name their community after Jean-Frédéric Oberlin (1740–1826), an Alsatian minister whose pedagogical achievements in a poor and remote area had greatly impressed and inspired them. Shipherd and Stewart rode south from Elyria into the forests that covered the northern part of Ohio in search of a suitable location for their community. After a journey of approximately eight miles, they stopped to rest and pray in the shade of an elm tree along the forest, and agreed that this would be a good place to start their community. Legend has it that while they prayed, a hunter saw a family of bears climb down from a nearby tree. The bears saw the two men, but turned away without harming them. On hearing this story from the hunter, the two ministers took it to be a sign from God that they had selected the right place for their community and school. Shipherd traveled back east and convinced the owner of the land to donate 500 acres (2.0 km 2) of land for the school, and he purchased an additional 5,000 acres (20 km 2) for the town, at the cost of $1.50 per acre ($371/km²). While in that part of the country, he visited many of his friends and persuaded some to join in his adventure, and others to contribute money towards the construction of the community. The motto of the new Oberlin Collegiate Institute was "Learning and Labor." In those days the words were taken quite literally: tuition at Oberlin was free, but students were expected to contribute by helping to build and sustain the community. Thi

It prevents additional viruses from entering. As the immune system is busy handling one virus it leaves the body open to attack from another virus. To prevent this there are several other defense mechanisms that turn on like increased mucus production, lack of hunger and tiredness. The flu virus and influenza virus does take advantage of this as it spreads though mucus that gets airborne after you cough. So it will also stimulate mucus production.

One could argue Britain, as 92 hereditary peers still have the right to sit in the House of Lords (for which they're paid £300 a day) and debate, analyse, alter and delay government bills. However, these peers were elected (out of the large number of former hereditary peers) by the other Lords, and will not pass on their Lordships to their own children. So, essentially, a (small) somewhat privileged nobility still exists, but this is the last generation of them.
For the most part, they don't. There are no mainstream scientific theories that purport the existence of wormholes. There are a lot of people, including some scientists, who *want* wormholes to exist, because they would give us the possibility of travelling interstellar distances, and some have come up with speculative theories on how wormholes might exist. But as of right now, there is no evidence to support those theories.
Not "glow in the dark" but fluorescent (i.e. visible under UV (black) light), yes, absolutely. You'd need to use a virus to transfect your cells.

>  Checking your credit score regularly can negatively impact your credit score. How is this fair if I'm trying to monitor my account history to make sure I'm on track. Soft checks (like some sites offer) don't hurt your credit score. But the reason doing a hard check (like a bank, or a car company does, or possibly what you've been doing) hurts your credit is because it appears that you're looking for credit, which means you may be more likely to need money, which means you're slightly less of a good person to loan money to. It's not a huge hit though if it's done sparingly.

What is a Mollusk? In many bivalves and snails, and in cephalopods, part of the mantle is modified into a siphon, which can be used to pump water through the mantle cavity for respiration, feeding and/or jet propulsion. Freshwater and marine mollusks have gills (called ctenidia) for respiration, located in the mantle cavity. In most bivalves, these are enlarged and serve to trap food particles as well (Morton 1983).

How to Plot Multiple Lines on an Excel Graph How to Plot Multiple Lines on an Excel Graphby John Michael Thomas When you create a line chart in Microsoft Excel, your chart may display only a single plot line. It's often helpful, however, to plot two or more lines on the same chart, for example you may have multiple data series that were collected at the same time, or you want to compare data taken at different times. To create an Excel chart with multiple lines, create a new chart with multiple plot lines or add plot lines to an existing chart. Create a New Chart With Multiple Lines Enter Your Data If you already have a spreadsheet with data entered into columns, skip to the next step ( Create Your Chart, below). Step 1: Enter the labels for each of the data series In the first row of the worksheet, enter the labels for each of the data series to plot. Since each data series (the data for each separate line to be plotted) must be in a separate column, you must enter the labels for each data series in a separate column on the first row. Excel uses the labels in the first row of each column to label the lines in the chart for the data in that column. Step 2: Enter your data Enter your data into each of your columns, in the rows below the labels. Here's an example worksheet showing two data series. The data for each series is in a separate column, and the label to display on the chart for each is in the first row of each column. Step 3: Create Your Chart1. Select all the cells in each column that contain your data.2. On the Office Ribbon select the Insert tab, click on Line in the Charts section of the ribbon, and then select the type of chart you want to create. Excel creates a new chart that displays a separate plot line for each column of data. Add a Line to an Existing Chart Step 1: Enter your new data Enter or copy and paste the data for the new plot line into the column immediately to the right of the original data. Make sure to add a label to the first row of the new column so the chart can display a label for the new plot line. Step 2: Select the chart Click on the chart that displays the original data to select it. Step 3: Edit the Chart data range Right-click on the chart and choose Select Data... from the pop-up menu. Alternately, click Select Data from the Data section of the Office Ribbon in the Chart Tools Design tab. The Select Data Source dialog opens. The data displayed in the chart is shown in the Chart data range field.4. In the Chart data range field, change the last letter of the displayed range, to make it match the letter of the last column of the new data. In the example, the Chart data range displays =Sheet2!$A$1:$A$12, but the new column of data is column $B. So the last A (in the cell reference $A$12) must be changed to a B. The resulting Chart data range displays =Sheet2!$A$1:$B$12. After changing the Chart data range, press the OK button. The chart updates to display an additional plot line for the new data.

dank dank You can describe something that is unpleasantly cool, damp, and clammy as dank. If you have ever visited a cave or unfinished basement, you know how a dank place feels. Yuck. The adjective dank is often used to describe places that would have moist or damp walls. A dank cave can provide hundreds of bats shelter, but you probably wouldn't want to visit them. Tunnels can also be choice dank locations: "The tunnel under the harbor was always dank, and the workers constantly had to battle mold and lichen on the tile walls." One way to remember dank 's meaning is to think of dark since they share three letters and seem to go together; a dank place is often a dark one as well.

Difference Between Composite & Component AV Cable Difference Between Composite & Component AV Cableby Shea Laverty Composite cable and component cables have similar names and both use RCA connectors; these traits in common often confuse people. However, despite these similarities there are several differences between these two audio-visual cable types. Number of Connectors The biggest difference between composite and component cables is the number of connectors on each. Basic composite cables have six male connectors -- two video and four audio. Specialized connectors often employed by devices such as gaming consoles usually only have four -- one video, two audio and one specialized output plug that connects to the device itself. Basic component cables have 10 connectors -- six for video and four for audio. Specialized component cables have only six connectors - three video, two audio and one specialized input cable for the output device. These are examples of the most common integrated composite and component; some are purely video cables that require a separate RCA audio cable. Connector Colors Another visible difference is the color of the connectors. Composite connectors feature three primary colors -- yellow for video, and white and red for audio. Sometimes the white or the red is replaced with a black connector instead, but typically yellow, red and white are the basic colors. Component connectors feature red, blue and green for video, and typically the same red and white for audio. Occasionally, the audio connectors will be designed differently, featuring dark covers with colored bands to differentiate the red audio from the red video. Sometimes the opposite is employed with the video cables featuring this different cover design, again to prevent confusion. Signal Division The way composite and component video cables transmit video data is also significantly different. Composite video cables transmit image data in a single line-level cable where video information is encoded into a single channel. Component instead divides the signal into three separate channels: YPBPR. Y represents luminance or the screen's brightness, while PB carries the difference between blue and the luminance and PR carries the difference between red and the luminance. Picture Quality Composite is limited in that it transmits lower-quality video. Typically, composite is limited to a resolution of 480i or 576i. Since this is only standard definition, modern high-definition images will not display optimally using composite video. Component can display content in both standard- or high-definition, from 480i to 1,080p -- and theoretically beyond. It is hampered only by the native resolution of the display device.

If any boy produces an outstanding piece of work, it may be "Sent Up For Good", storing the effort in the College Archives for posterity. This award has been around since the 18th century. As Sending Up For Good is fairly infrequent, the process is rather mysterious to many of Eton's boys. First, the master wishing to Send Up For Good must gain the permission of the relevant Head of Department. Upon receiving his or her approval, the piece of work will be marked with Sent Up For Good and the student will receive a card to be signed by House Master, tutor and division master.

> biologically wired to wake up several hours after sunrise and go to bed several hours after sunset It's not quite that simple. Exposure to sunlight, or artificial lighting that's close enough to sunlight, inhibits the production of hormones that make you feel tired. This is why we generally feel more tired when it's dark rather than when it's really bright. The amount of sleep each individual person needs will vary based on lifestyle as well as genes, too, so we aren't exactly hardwired to wake up "several hours after sunrise." When your body releases more tiredness hormones also depends on your sleeping habits, so if you wake up or go to sleep in a particular pattern for long enough, you will change when your body releases the hormones to match those times.  Having [one long sleep](_URL_0_) is also not how it has always been.

According to a study by the Australian National University, bees are very good at finding their way home, even over long dustances, and often rely on the position of the sun, the polarisation of light in the sky, the panorama view of the horizon and landmarks including towers, mountains or lakes. From that article: “In their forage trips, one way that honeybees use to find their way home is by storing distance and directional information when they venture out,” said Professor Zhang. “In other words, they try to go back the way they came." So bees rely on landmarks, the sky, and a general bearing of what direction they have traveled and can make it back home, even if it takes them multiple days. Though this probably begins to fail the further they go from the hive. Source: _URL_0_
Four months after fundraiser, Trump says he gave $1 million to veterans group 2:08Meet the ‘nasty’ reporter who got Trump to donate $1 million Almost four months after promising $1 million of his own money to veterans’ causes, Donald Trump moved to fulfill that pledge Monday evening — promising the entire sum to a single charity as he came under intense media scrutiny. Trump, now the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, organized a nationally televised fundraiser for veterans’ causes in Des Moines on Jan. 28. That night, Trump said he had raised $6 million, including the gift from his own pocket.“Donald Trump gave $1 million,” he said then. As recently as last week, Trump’s campaign manager had insisted that the mogul had already given that money away. But that was false: Trump had not. In recent days, The Washington Post and other media outlets had pressed Trump and his campaign for details about how much the fundraiser had actually raised and whether Trump had given his portion. The candidate refused to provide details. On Monday, a Post reporter used Twitter — Trump’s preferred social-media platform — to search publicly for any veterans groups that had received Trump’s money. By Monday afternoon, The Post had found none. But it seems to have caught the candidate’s attention. Later Monday evening, Trump called the home of James K. Kallstrom, a former FBI official who is chairman of the Marine Corps-Law Enforcement Foundation. The charity aids families of fallen Marines and federal law enforcement officers. Trump told Kallstrom that he would give the entire $1 million to the group, according to Kallstrom’s wife. Sue Kallstrom said she was not sure whether the money had been transferred yet. [ Trump said he raised $6 million for vets. Now his campaign says it was less. ]Other big donors to Trump’s fundraiser had already made their gifts weeks before. Why had Trump waited so long?“You have a lot of vetting to do,” Trump said Tuesday in a telephone interview conducted while he was flying to a campaign rally in Albuquerque. For this particular donation, it would seem that little new vetting was required because Trump already knew the recipient well. The Marine Corps-Law Enforcement Foundation had already received more than $230,000 in donations from the Donald J. Trump Foundation — a charity controlled by Trump but largely funded by others. Last year, the group gave Trump its “Commandant’s Leadership Award” at a gala in New York.0:00Copy Trump captures the nation’s attention as he campaigns View Photos The presidential candidate and billionaire businessman leads the field of candidates in the Republican race. When asked Tuesday whether he had given the money this week only because reporters had been asking about it, Trump responded: “You know, you’re a nasty guy. You’re really a nasty guy. I gave out millions of dollars that I had no obligation to do.”Trump’s call on Monday night stood in contradiction to an account given Friday by campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. “The money is fully spent,” Lewandowski said then. “Mr. Trump’s money is fully spent.”On Tuesday, Trump said Lewandowski would not have been in a position to know that. “I don’t know that Corey would even know when I gave it out,” he said. In the same interview, Trump said the fundraiser had raised about $5.5 million for veterans overall. He said he was not sure how much of it remained to be given away. That also contrasted with the account last week from Lewandowski, who said that about $4.5 million had been raised and that Trump’s effort had fallen short of the promised $6 million because some unnamed big donors had backed out. On Tuesday, Trump said no major contributors had reneged. “For the most part, I think they all came through,” he said. “Some of them came through very late.”Trump also said he had never actually promised that the fundraiser had raised $6 million. “I didn’t say six,” he said. But, in video of the event, Trump tells the crowd, “We just cracked $6 million! Right? $6 million.”Trump was told that he did, indeed, say “$6 million.”“We

In 1744, Burke started at Trinity College Dublin, a Protestant establishment, which up until 1793, did not permit Catholics to take degrees. In 1747, he set up a debating society, "Edmund Burke's Club", which, in 1770, merged with TCD's Historical Club to form the College Historical Society; it is the oldest undergraduate society in the world. The minutes of the meetings of Burke's Club remain in the collection of the Historical Society. Burke graduated from Trinity in 1748. Burke's father wanted him to read Law, and with this in mind he went to London in 1750, where he entered the Middle Temple, before soon giving up legal study to travel in Continental Europe. After eschewing the Law, he pursued a livelihood through writing.
Primary Education in the United States Primary Education in the United States In the US the first stage of compulsory education is generally known as elementary education. It takes place in elementary schools which usually incorporate the first five grades and sometimes have a kindergarten. Elementary schools in the US are also known as grade schools or grammar schools. In some schools, teachers utilize a "looping system" where the same teacher teaches the same group of students for two years. For example, a third-grade class may have one teacher who would teach those students for an entire year, then that teacher would teach fourth-grade the next year, and thereby teach the same class again. The teacher would then revert back to the third grade the following year to start the process all over with a different group of students. Over the past few decades, schools in the USA have been testing various arrangements which break from the one-teacher, one-class mould. Multi-age programmes, where children in different grades (e.g. Kindergarten through to second grade) share the same classroom and teachers, is one increasingly popular alternative to traditional elementary instruction. An alternative is that children might have a main class and go to another teacher's room for one subject, such as science, while the science teacher's main class will go to the other teacher's room for another subject, such as social studies. This could be called a two-teacher, two-class mould, or a rotation, similar to the concept of teams in junior high school. Another method is to have the children have one set of classroom teachers in the first half of the year, and a different set of classroom teachers in the second half of the year.‹ Primary Educationup Secondary Education ›

Endowed with a tasteful sense of fashion, Calvin Klein is one of America’s top fashion designers who created waves through his minimal yet classic designs. He never infused too many colours in his apparels. In fact, Klein best used neutral tones in his ensembles to give them richness and opulence. His Calvin Klein Empire which started off as a small coat company today proudly offers a wide range of products from apparels to fragrance, underwear to footwear and much more. While Klein’s chic designs were a rage, it was his launch of tight-fitting jeans that augmented both the company and his status by leaps and bounds. The denim wear collection had hit bull’s eye and became the talk of the town. As if this were any less, the 1980s witnessed a further boom after the launch of men’s innerwear. While Klein’s products received critical acclaim, his advertisements were severely criticized and created controversy for being outrageously provocative and socially irresponsible. Though the ads were eventually withdrawn, they gave the brand much needed publicity Recommended Lists: Fashion Designers American Men American Fashion Designers Scorpio Men Childhood & Early Life Calvin Richard Klein was born to Flo and Leo Stern on November 19, 1942 in Bronx, New York. He was the second of the three children that the couple had. Ever since he was a child, he intently watched his grandmother who was a seamstress. As such, he soon developed a love for sewing, which only deepened to become his passion and later profession. Interestingly, when kids of his age played sports, he spend hours sketching designs and sewing fashionable outfits. His mother encouraged his love for fashion and art. Upon finishing his elementary studies, he gained admission at the High School of Art and Design. Matriculating from the same, he enrolled at the esteemed Fashion Institute of Technology in New York from where he graduated in 1962. Career Klein’s first step in the professional and glamorous world of fashion came on 1962 as an apprentice worker for Dan Millestein, who owned a cloak and suit house. Enthusiastic and keen, he worked hard day and night to better his own designs. Meanwhile, he designed for other New York shops as well. In 1968, he collaborated with his childhood buddy, Barry Schwartz, to establish his own company, Calvin Klein. At the time of its initiation, the company was limited to being a coat shop. Klein bagged his first order from the Bonwit Teller—a large New York City clothing store. Interestingly, the order came as a result of sheer luck. A coat buyer from Bonwit Teller mistakenly got off on the wrong floor of a hotel on which Klein’ workroom was located and wandered into the workroom. Watching him work, she made a huge order worth $50,000. His first order was a huge hit and earned him rave reviews from both the public and fashion press. The store executives were impressed with his work and encouraged him to expand his line to sportswear as well. By 1971, Calvin Klein Company had grown dramatically. The establishment traded not just in coats, but sportswear, classic blazers and lingerie in its women’s collection. Within a matter of time, the Klein Empire became huge and highly successful and include

Deep Conditioning Your Weave Before you get a sew-in, make sure to deep condition the weave. Begin by washing it in warm water. Apply a deep conditioner to the weave from roots to ends. And then place the hair inside a plastic cap or bag. After 10-20 minutes, rinse off any excess conditioner and air dry. To deep condition sewn-in weave, you again want to wash the weave and braids with warm water. If there is product build-up on the braids, use a clarifying shampoo. Apply the deep conditioner and place a plastic cap over your head with all the weave inside.

. Home: Rat Systematics: Rats and mice Rats and mice: what's the difference? What do the terms rat and mouse mean? Differences between Norway rats and house mice How can I tell rats and mice apart? Quiz: rat or mouse? History and evolution of the Norway rat and the house mouse Common ancestry of the Norway rat and house mouse Brief history of the house mouse Brief history of the Norway rat and black rat Are rat-mouse hybrids possible? Mouse-killing behavior in rats: muricide What do the terms rat and mouse mean? Rat and mouse are actually not scientific classifications. These words are common names for rodents that look alike to the casual eye. Rat is used to describe medium-sized rodents with long thin tails. There are many species of rodent that are called rats -- kangaroo rats, cotton rats, Norway rats, black rats, African pouched rats, naked mole rats, wood rats, pack rats, Polynesian rats, and many others. These different rodent species may not be closely related to each other at all!Mouse is used to describe tiny, sparrow-sized rodents with long thin tails. As with rats, there are many species of rodents called mice which may or may not be closely related to each other: house mice, field mice, deer mice, smoky mice, spiny mice, and dormice are all called mice. So, which rats and mice are you talking about? Generally, people are referring to the domestic or pest rats and mice, which means Norway rats ( Rattus norvegicus ), black rats ( Rattus rattus ), and house mice ( Mus musculus ). Differences between Norway rats and house mice Norway rats and house mice belong to different species. A species is a group of related individuals or populations which are potentially capable of interbreeding and producing fertile offspring. So Norway rats and house mice belong to different species and cannot interbreed. Humans and orangutangs, chipmunks and red squirrels, bottlenosed dolphins and killer whales, all belong to different species. Norway rats and house mice are related, however. They descend from a common ancestor that lived millions of years ago -- how long ago is currently under debate, with estimates ranging from 8 to 41 million years ago. That estimate will probably become more precise over time. The descendants of that common ancestor diverged into different species, among which are Norway rats and house mice. Norway rats and house mice now have many genetic, reproductive, developmental, morphological and anatomical differences. The list below is not exhaustive, but for those with a casual interest it should get you started:• Genetic differnces: Norway rats have 22 chromosome pairs, house mice have 20 (see Levan 1991). Norway rats have 2.75 billion base pairs while mice have 2.6 billion (humans have 2.9). About 90% of rat genes have counterparts in the mouse and human genomes (Rat Genome Sequencing Consortium 2004). See Burt et al. 1999, Grutzner et al. 1999, and Watanabe et al . 1999 for more.• Growth differences: In general, Norway rats develop more slowly than house mice. For example, Norway rat gestation is slightly longer (21-24 days) than house mouse gestation (19-20 days). Norway rats lactate for about 3 weeks, house mice for 2 weeks. Both species are born naked and blind, but Norway rats open their eyes at 6 days, they are fully furred at 15 days. House mice open their eyes at 3 days, have fur at 10 days (etc. ).• Anatomical differences: Norway rats have 6 pairs of nipples, house mice have 5 pairs.• Morphological differences: Norway rats are larger, heavier and longer than house mice (Norway rat: 350-650 grams, 9-11 inch bodies and 7-9 inch tails; house mice: 30-90 grams, 3-4 inch bodies and 3-4 inch tails). Correlated with this larger size, Norway rat body parts are larger than those of the house mouse -- rats have larger ears, feet etc. The heads of Norway rats are heavy, blunt and chunky, house mouse heads are small and sharply triangular with pointed muzzles. Note, however, that Norway rats have smaller ears relative to their heads than house mice.• Sign differences: Due to their larger body size, rat fec
Biodiversity Information A biodiversity hotspot is a biogeographic region with a significant reservoir of biodiversity that is threatened with destruction The concept of biodiversity hotspots was originated by Dr. Norman Myers. The hotspots idea was also promoted by Russell Mittermeier in the popular book “Hotspots Revisited” (2004)To qualify as a biodiversity hotspot on Myers 2000 edition of the hotspot-map, a region must meet two strict criteria: it must contain at least 0.5% or 1,500 species of vascular plants as endemics, and it has to have lost at least 70% of its primary vegetation Around the world, at least 25 areas qualify under this definition, with nine others possible candidates. These sites support nearly 60% of the world's plant, bird, mammal, reptile, and amphibian species, with a very high share of endemic species

Overwatch  (video game) From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedianavigation search Overwatch Cover for the game's Origins Edition, featuring the hero character Tracer Developer (s) Blizzard Entertainment Publisher (s) Blizzard Entertainment Director (s)Jeff Kaplan Chris Metzen Aaron Keller Designer (s)Jeremy Craig Michael Elliott Scott Mercer Programmer (s)Mike Elliott John Le Fleur Artist (s)William Petras Arnold Tsang Writer (s) Michael Chu Composer (s) Derek Duke Platform (s)Microsoft Windows Play Station 4Xbox One Release May 24, 2016Genre (s) First-person shooter Mode (s) Multiplayer Overwatch is a team-based multiplayer first-person shooter video game developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment, which released on May 24, 2016 for Play Station 4, Xbox One, and Windows. Overwatch assigns players into two teams of six, with each player selecting from a roster of over 20 characters, known in-game as "heroes", each with a unique style of play, whose roles are divided into four general categories: Offense, Defense, Tank, and Support. Players on a team work together to secure and defend control points on a map or escort a payload across the map in a limited amount of time. Players gain cosmetic rewards that do not affect gameplay, such as character skins and victory poses, as they play the game. The game was initially launched with casual play, with a competitive ranked mode, various 'arcade' game modes, and a player-customizable server browser subsequently included following its release. Additionally, Blizzard has developed and added new characters, maps, and game modes post-release, while stating that all Overwatch updates will remain free, with the only additional cost to players being microtransactions to earn additional cosmetic rewards. Overwatch is Blizzard's fourth major franchise and came about following the 2014 cancellation of the ambitious massively multiplayer online role-playing game Titan. A portion of the Titan team came up with the concept of Overwatch, based on the success of team-based first-person shooters like Team Fortress 2 and the growing popularity of multiplayer online battle arenas, creating a hero-based shooter that emphasized teamwork. Some elements of Overwatch borrow assets and concepts from the canceled Titan project. After establishing the narrative of an optimistic near-future Earth setting after a global crisis, the developers aimed to create a diverse cast of heroes that spanned genders and ethnicities as part of this setting. Significant time is spent adjusting the balance of the characters, making sure that new players would still be able to have fun while skilled players would present each other with a challenge. Overwatch was unveiled at Blizz Con 2014 in a fully playable state and was in a closed beta from late 2015 through early 2016. An open beta in May 2016 drew in nearly 10 million players. The release of the game was promoted with short animated videos to introduce the game's narrative and each of the characters. Upon official release, Overwatch received universal acclaim from critics, who praised the game for its accessibility, diverse appeal of its hero characters, bright cartoonish art style, and enjoyable gameplay. Blizzard reported over US$1 billion in revenue during the first year of its release, and had more than 35 million players by the end of 2017. Considered one of the best games released in 2016, the game received numerous accolades, including being awarded Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2016, D. I. C. E. Awards, and Game Developers Choice Awards, as well as from numerous publications. Since its release, Overwatch has become recognized as an e Sport, with Blizzard helping to fund and produce professional leagues, such as the Overwatch League.

The buyer discloses the financing arrangements to the seller because it makes his offer more attractive. When a seller receives and accepts an offer, the deal does not usually close until 30 to 60 days later.  If the buyer cannot come up with the money by closing, the deal falls apart.  This is a risk for the seller. When a seller is considering whether or not to accept an offer, it is helpful to know the likelihood that the buyer can actually obtain the amount of cash in the offer by the closing date.  If the buyer can't acquire the funding, the offer isn't worth the paper it is printed on. The amount of the down payment vs. the amount of financing is also relevant to the seller.  Let me give you a real-world example that happened to me once when I was selling a house.  The buyer was doing a no-money-down mortgage and had no money for a down payment.  He was even borrowing the closing costs.  We accepted the offer, but when the bank did the appraisal, it was short of the purchase price.  For most home sales, this would not be a problem, as long as the appraisal was more than the amount borrowed.  But in this case, because the amount borrowed was more than the appraisal, the bank had a problem.  The deal was at risk, and in order to continue either the buyer had to find some money somewhere (which he couldn't), or we had to lower the price to save the deal.  Certainly, accepting the offer from a buyer with no cash to bring to the table was a risk. (In our case, we got lucky. We found some errors that were made in the appraisal, and got it redone.)
The Ottomans abolished the feudal system previously in place and applied the millet system to Cyprus, under which non-Muslim peoples were governed by their own religious authorities. In a reversal from the days of Latin rule, the head of the Church of Cyprus was invested as leader of the Greek Cypriot population and acted as mediator between Christian Greek Cypriots and the Ottoman authorities. This status ensured that the Church of Cyprus was in a position to end the constant encroachments of the Roman Catholic Church. Ottoman rule of Cyprus was at times indifferent, at times oppressive, depending on the temperaments of the sultans and local officials, and the island began over 250 years of economic decline.

The levels of scrutiny establish that, when a law discriminates against certain protected groups, it should be looked at more closely. For instance, if a law treats black and white people differently, the government must show to an *extremely* high standard that the law is necessary. If a law treats adults and minors differently, the most handwavy explanation will usually be enough. Homosexuality has traditionally been in the "not a big deal" category; courts haven't tended to apply additional scrutiny to a law simply because it discriminates against LGBT people. If SCOTUS decides to hear those cases, some people expect them to impose a higher standard.

The Paleozoic spanned from roughly 541 to 252 million years ago (Ma) and is subdivided into six geologic periods; from oldest to youngest they are the Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous and Permian. Geologically, the Paleozoic starts shortly after the breakup of a supercontinent called Pannotia and at the end of a global ice age. Throughout the early Paleozoic, the Earth's landmass was broken up into a substantial number of relatively small continents. Toward the end of the era the continents gathered together into a supercontinent called Pangaea, which included most of the Earth's land area.

Just like veal, the cattle are kept fairly sedentary, so their muscles never really develop. They are fed a fairly high fat diet, and the strain of cattle have a lot of intramuscular fat, aka well marbled.

Lactic acid technically isn't metabolized by the body, but when in the body the acid loses a proton and becomes lactate, its conjugate base. Then the lactate is carried in blood to the liver, where it is converted by enzymes into pyruvate, which in turn is converted into glucose, then dumped back into the blood to be used by other cells. This process is called Gluconeogenesis, and keeps your blood glucose levels normal, even during intense exercise!

Body Weight Workouts Here’s a good exercise. You just hold this pose for a long time. It works your whole freakin body. Start out lying on your stomach. Then prop yourself up on your toes and forearms, with your arms facing in front of you, and your hands together. Keep your body in a straight line. If your stomach slips toward the floor, you’re too tired or weak. Hold this for 30 or 60 seconds, or maybe 5 minutes if you’re good. Then do a couple more reps! P. S. That’s my shirt hanging down to the floor, not my gut! Advertisements Report this ad Report this ad Rate this:1 Vote Like One blogger likes this.
